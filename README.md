# HOTOSM Website

This repo is the codebase for the main Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team website. See `gh-pages` branch for Jekyll code. If looking for the previous Drupal codebase, see the current `master` branch.

 - See the [issues queue](https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm-website/issues) for all discussions and tasks.
 - Chat available on [HOTOSM Slack](https://slack.hotosm.org/) within the #hotosm-website channel.

## Getting Started with Development

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). To get started on GNU/Linux, Unix, or macOS, you must meet the following requirements:

  * Ruby 2.2.5 or above
  * RubyGems
  * GCC and Make

First, install [bundler](https://bundler.io/).

```
gem install bundler
```

Next, use bundler to install the build dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

Then, start Jekyll with bundler (this resolves any dependency issues you may have):

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```

Finally, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ and you should see the new website!
