Intro Text: HOT's Community Microgrant program provides support for OpenStreetMap
  (OSM) Communities in low- and middle-income countries with the resources they need
  to launch and grow their activities and impact. Microgrants enable communities to
  implement their mapping activities, improve the availability and quality of map
  data in OSM, aid the development of leadership and technology skills, and help communities
  with disaster response efforts.

Since 2017, HOT’s microgrant program has 
* provided 80 grants to OSM communities in 32 countries 
* helped micrograntees make 13 million map edits in their local communities
* supported micrograntees in training 15,000 mappers

As part of the Community Microgrant offering, HOT provides training and mentoring to Micrograntees through the grant application and reporting process. This includes technical training, training in open tools and open data collection, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, finances and record keeping, leadership skills, project management skills, communications, and partnership development.  The program covers costs such as transport fares, internet, devices, food, and stipends for local individuals to lead the setup and strengthening of their communities. 

Microgrants are frequently awarded to communities who demonstrate they are working in collaboration with a local data user (this can be local or regional governmental, a local NGO, or a community-based organization). Local collaborators ensure that the data generated during the grant period will be used in community development strategies, disaster response, and planning, and will benefit the wider community locally.

HOT’s Microgrant Programs include: 

**Annual Microgrants**
Each year HOT supports local OSM communities with Microgrants, device grants, and training to provide the tools and resources needed to operate and engage in mapping activities. More information can be found on the [2020 Microgrants](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants_2020), [2019 Microgrants](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/hot-microgrants-2019-the-highlights/), [2018 Microgrants](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2018-02-06_hot_2018_microgrants_programme_launch!), and [2017 Microgrants](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2017-02-21_2017_microgrants_programme_in_full_swing_-_read_our_q&a_summary) on the [HOT Blog](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/). 

**Rapid Response Microgrants**
This funding is designated specifically for activities that focus on local response to disaster. HOT’s first Rapid Response Microgrant program was for remote-based activities that focussed on the global COVID-19 pandemic.  Visit the HOT blog for more information on the [Rapid Response Microgrant: COVID-19 Program](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/rapid-response-microgrants-covid-19/). 

**Facebook Community Impact Microgrants**
This program is kindly supported by Facebook and is focused on training and community engagement activities, with priority given to projects which include an approach that engages women and girls in mapping activities. Find out more information on the first of three rounds of [Community Impact Microgrants via HOT’s blog](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/facebook-community-impact-microgrants/). 

**Devolved Microgrants** 
This program grants funding to an open mapping focussed organization for them to design, develop and implement their own microgrant program. The program is being piloted with OpenMapDevelopment Tanzania (OMDTZ).
