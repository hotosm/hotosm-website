Intro Text: HOT's Community Microgrant program provides support for OpenStreetMap
  (OSM) Communities in low- and middle-income countries with the resources they need
  to launch and grow their activities and impact. Microgrants enable communities to
  implement their mapping activities, improve the availability and quality of map
  data in OSM, aid the development of leadership and technology skills, and help communities
  with disaster response efforts.

Since 2017, HOT’s microgrant program has 
* provided 64 grants to OSM communities in 32 countries 
* helped micrograntees make 10 million map edits in their local communities
* supported micrograntees in training 13,000 mappers
* enabled the contribution of 8 million buildings and 825,000 km road to OSM

As part of the Community Microgrant offering, HOT provides training and mentoring to Micrograntees through the grant application and reporting process. This includes technical training, training in open tools and open data collection, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, finances and record keeping, leadership skills, project management skills, communications, and partnership development.  The program covers costs such as transport fares, internet, devices, food, and stipends for local individuals to lead the setup and strengthening of their communities. 

Microgrants are frequently awarded to communities who demonstrate they are working in collaboration with a local data user (this can be local or regional governmental, a local NGO or community based organisation). Local collaborators ensure that the data generated during the grant period will be used in community development strategies, disaster response and planning, and will benefit the wider community locally.

HOT’s Microgrant Programs include: 

**Annual Microgrants**
Each year HOT supports local OSM communities with Microgrants, device grants, and training to provide the tools and resources needed to operate and engage in mapping activities.
