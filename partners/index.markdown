position: 0
Intro Text: "HOT collaborates with a wide range of organizations to leverage open
  source tools and join resources to generate crucial data so that humanitarian work
  and disaster response efforts are able to reach vulnerable areas. Through training,
  shared expertise and large scale volunteering, we help organizations run rapid field
  data collection campaigns, and improve the way they use technology and open map
  data. \n\nOver the next five years HOT will engage one million volunteers to map
  places home to one billion people who are living in poverty or at high risk of disaster
  in 94 countries. There are many ways we can work together to achieve this!"
