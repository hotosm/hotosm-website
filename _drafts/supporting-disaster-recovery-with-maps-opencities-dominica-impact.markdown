  to identify needs and shortfalls in information. The utility of OSM data as a tool
  in disaster preparedness has proven to be crucial.

**The** **OpenCities Dominica project focused on increasing map data** to support Dominica’s communities and government in accessing more accurate, up-to-date data, information and mapping insight about hazards and their exposure on the people and infrastructure.

The new datasets produced proved to be valuable for hazard analysis, particularly given the island’s recent history with [highly destructive storms](https://www.gfdrr.org/en/dominica-hurricane-maria-post-disaster-assessment-and-support-recovery-planning) and Dominica’s own commitment to becoming a more resilient nation.

This blogpost provides an overview of the impact of the OpenCities Dominica project. Please see the project IMPACT REPORT for more details.

The Commonwealth of Dominica is also known as “the Nature Isle” due to its lush forest nestled in rugged terrain. However, recent extreme storm events have severely impacted and threatened the inhabitants’ way of life as well as the environment. The ravages of Hurricane Maria (September 2017) are still evident around Dominica’s landscape and communities today. The scars and impacts of legacy storms are also still present as they notably increase the vulnerability of communities and property owners.

While expertise from international agencies and the national government itself have documented and modeled the physical evidence of past events, activity is often concentrated around high impact, high visibility events. This results in a lack of granularity of detail to allow for household and community resilience planning. The project activities were informed by pre-interviews with key agencies, identifying their needs and shortfalls in information availability and plans for future program developments.

***A Solid Foundation for Future Work***

In keeping with the community-led approach, [volunteer mappers](https://emonewsdm.com/local-tech-company-open-solutions-begins-mapping-exercise-for-resilience-building/) from the communities received training not just in data collection but also in the analysis of the results to identify risk - highlighting the utility of OSM data as a tool in disaster preparedness. Training sessions, mapathons and field mapping exercises were held, using data collection platforms such as Vespucci and ODK applications.

The activities focused on three areas, [the capital city Roseau](https://www.q95da.com/news/the-youth-emergency-action-committees-yeac-and-open-s), the flood-prone community of Coulibistrie and the landslide susceptible community of Dos D’Ane. The project has created a solid foundation with [many key stakeholders](https://emonewsdm.com/local-tech-company-open-solutions-begins-mapping-exercise-for-resilience-building/) including local government and agencies as well as aid organizations, many of which are excited about the project, eager to see the same carried out for their communities.

The methodology developed can be duplicated through agencies mandated and interested in vulnerability and risk assessments as well as asset management. More than 20 government officials were trained in the use of open data, a total overall of 54 trained participants of which 72 % were women, new features mapped: 260 and overall a population of more than 15,230 people impacted by the mapping exercise.

The CREAD Project (Climate Resilience Execution Agency for Dominica) has agreed to work with its partners in formatting the workflows into their tasks for attending to their list of Most Vulnerable Communities affected by Hurricane Maria. Other foreign agencies operating in Dominica, such as IsraAid have shown interest in utilizing the data and methodology in performing assessments for asset mapping of critical infrastructures on the island.
