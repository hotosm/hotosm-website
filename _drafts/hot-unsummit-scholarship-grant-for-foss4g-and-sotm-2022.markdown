In 2022, the HOT unSummit aims to develop collaborations and partnerships with communities, organizations and networks that are organizing conference events. You can read more about the 2022/2023 HOT summit approach [here](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/).

As part of the support developed for this new approach, the HOT unSummit is offering travel funding for active HOT and humanitarian open mapping / open data contributors and community members to attend two of the conferences we are supporting, FOSS4G and SOTM in Firenze, Italy in August 2022. Depending on the availability of budget, we may release another call for online attendance support scholarship in July or August.

# Travel Support Grant

## Coverage

The Travel Grant may include up to the amount required for a full conference ticket/s, flight ticket, travel insurance and accommodation, as well as reimbursable funds for Visa and other expenses, i.e. local transport, PCR tests (if required), etc. We may offer top-ups for applicants who have existing funding but will need more support.

We don’t yet know exactly how many community members we can fund as it depends on where people are coming from, but we hope the funds we have will be enough to get, at minimum, ten people to the conferences.
