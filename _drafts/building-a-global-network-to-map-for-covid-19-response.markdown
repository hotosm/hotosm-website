In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic - the largest public health crisis of the 21st century so far - there was uncertainty about how mapping could be used to support response efforts. It quickly became clear that the 1 billion people living in completely or partially unmapped communities risked being left out of life-saving programs and access to healthcare and other forms of support. By the end of March 2020, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) put a plan in place to focus on three key areas: 

* Helping government agencies and responders to identify where unmapped vulnerable populations were located to plan for cash-based interventions; 
* Identifying where at-risk populations of the most vulnerable people live, including the 60+ population and those with pre-existing conditions such as HIV/AIDS) as well as missing data on health infrastructure such as facilities, testing sites, pharmacies and laboratories, and resource distribution centers;
* Funding local mapping groups via Rapid Response Emergency Microgrants in places most at risk. 

Supported by the [Humanitarian-to-Humanitarian Network](https://h2hnetwork.org) (H2H), HOT coordinated the most extensive disaster activation in its history. Over the course of 2020, the response grew into a network of teams, online volunteers, national governments, and local communities supporting mapping responses around the world. HOT’s role in this response covered a wide range of activities, including managing remote mapping projects worldwide, validating data quality, engaging in humanitarian outreach, data management support and training, data analysis and visualization, and web map creation.

## Supporting Local Responses

Hyper-local mapping has been a cornerstone of this response. As local governments, ministries of health, public health and disaster management NGOs, and other local response organizations identified data gaps, such as under-mapped areas and vital health services missing from maps, HOT coordinated with local data and mapping experts in the OpenStreetMap community in the same country to support them with data creation. The data they created was then recorded and shared in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), an open-source, freely accessible, and editable map of the world.

After a very successful initial engagement with mapping and training in Peru, the H2H network helped HOT coordinate mapping in eleven more countries (Anguilla, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Mali, Philippines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago). Communities in six other countries (Brazil, Colombia, Marshall Islands, Nepal, Somalia, and Sri Lanka) coordinated mapping campaigns on their own using tools developed or supported by HOT, such as the [Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/), [LearnOSM](https://learnosm.org/en/), and [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org/). 

Additionally, seven local mapping communities received microgrants funded by HOT’s corporate partners ([first round](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/rapid-response-microgrants-covid-19/), [second round](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/second-round-of-rapid-response-micrograntees-announced/)) to facilitate their impact. The grants enabled the acquisition of equipment to expedite and scale up their work, and also supported outreach and training to expand local mapping communities. H2H contributed to the impact of these microgrants by supporting training in creating and using geodata for the micrograntees and the COVID-19 response organization they worked with. 

### Global Response

To support these local communities’ efforts, HOT’s Disaster Services Team and volunteers mobilized the online mapping community to rapidly digitize satellite imagery. This global community is a network of local OSM chapters, informal communities, volunteer organizations, and individuals united by an interest in mapping for the global good. 

As a result, in Botswana, over 70% of the country was prioritized for remote mapping. Since this mapping began three months ago, about half of those projects have been fully mapped and validated - enabling the Ministry of Health to deliver hygiene kits to remote villages. In addition to mapping, HOT provided training in creating and using maps based on OpenStreetMap to partner organizations like the Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières in Uganda.

Together, these efforts recorded local knowledge of the situation and critical infrastructure for both public health and logistics, such as clinics, hospitals, roads, and ports.  This data is available to not just in-country partners but also global level responders, including [UNOCHA](https://www.unocha.org/), and other members of the H2H network such as [MapAction](https://mapaction.org/), and [CartONG](https://www.cartong.org/). They have free access to the data on online platforms, including [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/), the [HOT Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org/en/v3/), and [OpenStreetMap exports](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export); and where useful, can download it as mobile, offline maps using services like [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) and [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net).

## Unprecedented Scale

The scale of this response is unprecedented in the history of humanitarian mapping in OSM. As of January 28, 2021, over 22,800 volunteers have added 4.6 million map features to OpenStreetMap to support COVID-19 responses. These edits have included digitizing more than 4.1 million buildings and over 100,000 kilometers of road around the world. 

This data was requested by 33 local groups, organizations, and in one case - an individual mapper looking to improve awareness of services in their city. Between remote mapping projects, microgrants, local community efforts, training, and other projects HOT has been supporting, there are a total of 28 countries impacted by these COVID-19 prevention, response, and relief efforts. HOT is also evaluating 11 additional countries in the Caribbean as part of a joint hurricane and pandemic preparedness initiative.  

An activation of this scale required coordination and un-siloing of teams within HOT to a degree not attempted before. The initial demand for creating and managing projects on the Tasking Manager required us to rapidly increase our capacity, assigning additional staff and recruiting volunteers. This evolved into an expanded disaster services team serving as a hub of coordination between technical, project, community, and communications staff on an ongoing basis.

## The Impact of Mapping

The mapping of under-mapped communities has helped to ensure they are not overlooked in the pandemic response. The map data has also helped public health authorities identify at-risk populations that would be vulnerable to the pandemic itself or lockdown measures meant to stop its spread that could cut households off from food markets and livelihoods.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown what a large and sustained effort the humanitarian community is capable of. The number of contributors is three times larger than the next largest activation of 7,500 volunteers for Nepal’s 2015 Gorkha earthquake. This is a testament to the broader mapping community’s drive and initiative, as many were responding to the pandemic on their own initiative and making use of the Tasking Manager to create and manage their COVID-19 mapping projects.

In addition to supporting the COVID-19 response, expanding the disaster services team has increased HOT’s capacity to respond to future crises by engaging with and supporting the wider mapping community’s efforts.
