Guest blogpost from Amna Adrees written during her travels between Arua and Rhino/ Imvepi Camps when working with the HOT Uganda team.

My past two years working on global health and development in the epicentre of the field - Washington, D.C. - gave me a good understanding of the refugee crisis and the problems faced by displaced populations around the world. Or so I had thought. 

Over time, I have come to value experience over theory. No amount of rote knowledge can replace the understanding your senses provide you. Read all the poetry in the world, but until you experience love, you do not know what it means to find home in another being. Study music theory all you want, but it can never invoke the feeling of transcendence that the sound of a sitar brings with it. The refugee crisis is no exception. Nothing prepared me for witnessing the aftermath of the mass migration of people fleeing war and conflict. 

Uganda has an open-door policy towards refugees. South Sudanese, Congolese, Somali, Ethiopian, and Eritrean nationals arrive at Uganda’s doorstep, where they are taken under the wing of the Office of the Prime Minister and transported to refugee camps nearby. There are currently estimated to be ~1.4 million refugees in the country. It is here that, after a 25 hour flight with two layovers and multiple anti-nausea tablets, I arrived, eager to work with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to promote the mapping of refugee environments for humanitarian purposes. 

I spent my first few days getting oriented in the HOT office in Kampala (and thoroughly enjoying all the city has to offer – rolex stands need to make their way to the States, pronto!) before heading north to Arua. Both the Rhino and Imvepi camps are located near this area. Our task was simple – we train refugee students and teachers on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform and mobile data collection in three secondary schools: Ofua Secondary School, Rhino High School, and Imvepi Secondary School. We set off from Kampala at 10 AM on Tuesday and two car breakdowns, a driving ticket, a taxi, and 15 hours later, Shamillah, Allan, and I finally arrived.

A bit more about HOT’s mission before I continue: HOT, through trainings, promotes the utilization of OSM, a free and open source software that provides satellite imagery from various sources to be traced and tagged remotely by anyone that wants to contribute to a fully mapped globe. HOT also utilizes a mobile application called OpenDataKit (ODK), which surveyors use to collect GPS coordinates and attributes of various points of interests (i.e. schools, hospitals, water points, latrines, etc.) that are then fed into OpenStreetMap for public consumption. Introducing these tools to refugee schools was something I was particularly supportive of because they not only exposed refugee communities to new technology, but also provided them with a sense of ownership and accountability of their living and work spaces.

Shamilah, Allan, and I spent the next three days visiting the schools and training – while this was quite an experience in and of itself, I want to focus on the takeaways that I gained instead of the process. 

The biggest sentiment that I left with was one of frustration. We introduced interesting and helpful technology to students who many times do not even have access to power, much less computer labs. A one-off training in these circumstances is limited in its ability to leave a lasting impact. Ignorance is bliss they say; introducing laptops and cellphones and selfies, opening these students’ eyes to such resources without a means to access in the future, may be doing more damage than good.

Selfie time! The students absolutely loved being able to take pictures 

Integration of the various humanitarian efforts underway in Uganda is a big first step to creating more sustainable benefits to the refugee community. While all humanitarian funding goes through one channel, UNHCR, there must be an increase in collaboration within the sector to identify gaps in resources to allow for more strategic distribution of aid. Sanitation training in schools that do not have access to water? Pointless. Bednet distribution in camps that have not been educated on the how-tos and whys of net use? Futile. There must be a greater push to coordinate efforts if we truly want to make a different in refugee communities. HOT’s mapping endeavors, if properly utilized, are very helpful in identifying problems in the settlements that need to be taken into consideration when planning resource distribution. If the humanitarian sector at large adapts HOT’s maps into its planning process, there is the potential to greatly reduce the inconsistencies in aid dispersal and increase the impact interventions have in refugee communities. 

One last note: seeing and hearing Ugandans’ warm and welcoming attitude towards refugees was such a breath of fresh air. I found Uganda to be a far less antagonistic host country than America, both in policy and in practice, despite its greater limitation on resources. America could learn a thing or two on how to approach displaced populations from Uganda…
