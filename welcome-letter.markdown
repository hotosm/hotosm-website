Volunteer humanitarian mappers are making a real difference on the ground in the [areas we map](/our-work/). We can not thank you enough for your help and contributions. The most important thing is that if you have any questions, please ask! We love to answer questions, it helps the whole community when people ask questions.

You can jumpstart your mapping journey using the Tasking Manager through the **[Learn page](https://tasks.hotosm.org/learn/)** which has videos and manuals for beginners, validators and managers.

### Contacting us and communicating

- The best way to ask is to join the HOT Slack community (specifically the #mapper-support channel) which have many topic focused channels as well as channels for general chat, introductions and random thought; sign up at [https://slack.hotosm.org](https://slack.hotosm.org/)
- You can also join the humanitarian mailing list, where there are a lot of friendly people, both new mappers and experts: [https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/hot](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/hot)

In closing, we want to say: **Welcome, we are very happy you stopped by and we hope to see more of you in the future.**
Thank you again and best wishes from the whole Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Community!

<br>
*[Courtney Clark](/people/courtney-clark) and the HOT Community*
