  Title: A brief history of the OpenSummit
  Text: |-
    After years of gathering together in just one place for our annual conference, in 2022 we launched the *HOT unSummit*, a decentralized, year-long program of 13 global, regional, and local conferences worldwide, where each community brought together its own perspectives on open mapping, OpenStreetMap, humanitarian response, and social impact.

    This year, the *unSummit* comes back as the **OpenSummit**!

  Title: Propose a Conference
  Text: |-
    We encourage collaboration with local organizing committees (LOCs) for existing conferences that focus on open mapping or humanitarian/development work relevant to open mapping. These events should align closely with the criteria set for the HOT OpenSummit event collaborations. Priority will be given to conferences in HOT's priority countries.

    Examples of previous conferences include: State of the Map Asia, State of the Map Tanzania, and the Pacific Geospatial Conference.

  Title: Propose an Intervention in a 3rd Party Event
  Text: "We seek to support and collaborate with open mapping groups to bring open
    mapping to new or relevant audiences. This collaboration can take various forms,
    such as satellite events, content tracks, social events, etc. The goal is to promote
    open data awareness, advocacy, and collaborations/partnerships, particularly in
    non-traditional open mapping spaces and with map user audiences. \n\nExamples
    of these from the past year include: The Teto Brasil annual gathering,  Cidade
    em Foco (Brazil), Zimbabwe Institute of Geomatics Conference."

  Title: Propose a Community Event
  Text: "We aim to support national or local open mapping communities coming together
    to share experiences, develop skills, build relationships, and, most importantly,
    to foster collaborative humanitarian open mapping activities. These community
    events do not need to be pre-existing and can be small-scale. Selection criteria
    for these events include their ability to provide value to the communities that
    HOT supports and their contribution to movement building. \n\nExamples of such
    events from the past year include: Yekastreet series (Nicaragua) and ENEG (National
    Meeting of Geography Students (Mexico)\n"
