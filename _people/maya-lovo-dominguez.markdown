I participated in the Alpha Stage of the Latin American Hub as a consultant for a project in Central America that explores the relationship between migration, gender, and open mapping. Currently, I'm a Sub-regional coordinator for projects in Central America, where I collaborate with local organizations to explore, understand and use open geographic data. 

I was raised in El Salvador and currently study my undergraduate in Mexico City. In 2021 I joined the YouthMappers network and have been working since then with open and free geospatial software. As part of the current activities with HOT, we're working towards strengthening the mapping community in the region, by working with different stakeholders.
