Anni Beukes is an urban researcher working at the intersection of poverty, place, and politics. She seeks to understand how the processes and technologies of knowledge making, especially the creation and use of digital mapping tools, affect communities and populations - especially young people, living in marginalized neighborhoods in developing cities. Currently a Phd candidate at the University of Bonn, Germany, her present research seeks to spatialise water insecurity in slums/informal settlements in developing cities in sub-Saharan Africa and how this impacts the lived experiences and opportunities of young people. Anni held a Visiting Fellowship with the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society at the University of Chicago and spent 2 years as Institute Resident Fellow of the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation also at the University of Chicago. Before joining the Mansueto Institute, she spent four years with Slum Dwellers International (SDI) where she was responsible for SDI’s data ecosystem, from community managed data collection, to data platform management, analysis and partnerships. She led SDI’s efforts at the intersection of organized community groups, researchers, technologists and software developers to create and refine tools, methods and practices for community-driven knowledge production. Anni holds degrees in social anthropology from University Stellenbosch in South Africa.
