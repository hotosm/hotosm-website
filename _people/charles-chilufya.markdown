I am a Qualified Records and Archivist manager, Information Specialist, GIS analyst, and OSM trainer as well as a Mapper and Validator. I am the co-founder of Local Knowledge Mappers in Zambia and Chairperson.
One thing I know for sure is that I cannot directly influence the decision-makers in my community. However, I am fortunate to be naturally passionate about open mapping,  humanitarian, governance, and Technology. What drives me is the ability to indirectly influence policymakers by providing them with relevant data that results from mapping, which can lead to decisions that benefit many communities.
