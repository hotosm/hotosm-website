I am Dhivya Manoj, a skilled GIS professional with a robust background in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing. Holding a Master's degree in GIS and Remote Sensing and a Bachelor's degree in Town and Country Planning, I have cultivated a strong foundation in spatial analysis, project management, and urban planning.

My passion for open mapping and humanitarian efforts has driven me to actively engage in OpenStreetMap (OSM) related activities. In my role as a former Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Data Quality Intern, I collaborated on projects involving the validation of OpenStreetMap data across multiple countries. This experience significantly enhanced my proficiency in geospatial tools, including ArcGIS, QGIS, and JOSM.

I am enthusiastic about contributing my GIS expertise to the HOT community, leveraging both my educational background and hands-on experience to support the organization's mission. With a keen interest in spatial analysis and mapping technologies, I am confident that my contributions as a Voting Member will be impactful and aligned with the goals of HOT.
