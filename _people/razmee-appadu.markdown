Razmee holds an MBA in International Business. She recently completed a Master’s degree in Intellectual Property law, with her thesis focusing on how copyright law intersects with the agenda for sustainable development, analyzing how international copyright legislation in developing countries impacts open innovation, gender equality, and accessibility for persons with disabilities.
Razmee loves learning new languages and about new cultures. She spends as much time as possible by the sea and in nature. She has studied a few dance forms, including Bharatanatyam and flamenco. She hopes to learn and grow to contribute further to the sustainable development goals, humanitarian and development work.
