Laura is a Geospatial engineer and technical community manager working at the intersection of open data, free and open-source software, and sustainable development. With a commitment to building for impact, she harnesses the power of communities to drive positive change.

She is currently a Community Coordinator at Code for Africa, managing africanDRONE and sensors.AFRICA project and community activities. These initiatives pioneer the use of drones and sensors for climate change and deforestation monitoring, water & air quality, pollution detection in African cities, and open data collection and mapping.

Before joining CfA, she worked at a Kenyan social enterprise to support teams scaling sanitation and regenerative agriculture in Kenya to adopt data for good.

In her free time, Laura volunteers with tech communities. She has been a YouthMappers regional ambassador for the last four years, supporting student-led and faculty-mentored university clubs in East and Central Africa to use open mapping and GIS for community development.
