<p>I came across HOT in 2019 through MapSwipe. At the time I was volunteering with Red Cross and also researching different ways to contribute to humanitarian causes. Mapping caught my attention. Since then, I have been involved in many different events, projects and am regularly attending mapathons and contributing my time to promote HOT's mission.</p>
