<p>I was introduced to HOT at State of the Map 2011 and really began contributing in 2012 mostly through the tasking manager.&nbsp; In 2013 I assisted with writing the Code of Conduct and participated in several Working Groups.&nbsp; In late 2013 I was selected as Junior Coordinator for the Mapping Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia project and spent four weeks in the field training and mapping.&nbsp; At the beginning of 2014 I was nominated to the HOT Membership and elected as the Chair for the Voting Members. 2015 I was elected for a second term as Chairperson and was selected as the Activation Curriculum Specialist.</p><p>In late 2016 I was selected as Project Manager for the Eliminate Malaria Mapping Campaign, at that point HOT's largest ever project in terms of geographic size - every building in a 560,000 square kilometer area of interest across seven countries was digitized. At the end of 2017 I began working as Project Manager for the Facebook AI-Assisted Road Mapping which still continues today. Throughout that time I was also volunteering as the Disaster Mapping Coordinator, joining or leading our teams to facilitate the flow of geospatial information from the crowd to the first responders and aid agencies in times of crises.</p><p>In 2018 I met my wife at the State of the Map - Milan conference and in 2019 we were married and had our son. Also in 2019 Cyclone Idai struck and with that response, the Humanitarian To Humanitarian (H2H) Network launched and for the first time since our modern definition of Activation was created, we were funded for an incident response. With another long-term commitment from H2H for COVID mapping in 2020, we began the first scale-up of the program to 3 full-time committed staff, including myself. Now backed by the Audacious Project through 2025, we look to make that a permanent expansion and will additional recruit regional disaster associates in our hub-offices. On top of it all, I also represent HOT in the Missing Maps partnership, mainly through my role as volunteer Project Manager for <a href="http://mapswipe.org/">Mapswipe</a> and often consult with our Technical as well as Partnerships and Community teams when they need the long-term expertise to make things work.</p>
