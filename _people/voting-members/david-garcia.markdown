In the Philippines, I was working as a geographer and urban planner in cities and communities that were hit by disaster or war. At present, I am based in Aotearoa New Zealand. At this stage of my life, I am becoming a scholar of Geographic Information Science. My PhD project is an ethnography of crowdsourcing and mapping by working on OpenStreetMap in the Pacific region.

I love making maps about my home, the Pacific. The ocean is us. And we are the ocean.
