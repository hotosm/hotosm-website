I am an OSMapper from Bangladesh, a HOT voting member, OSMBD voting member, OSMF contributing member, OSM trainer, validator, and OSM guru, a GIS expert, and a volunteer for OSM, HOT, MissingMaps, Mapillary, and Tanzania Development Trust. I love taking an unmapped area and then completely mapping it. I mostly map solo with my own objectives. I enjoy making maps, learning new stuff, reading, traveling, and making meaningful contribution. In my professional life, I am the lead for the creative services team in Save the Children in Bangladesh. Moreover, I am a Google certified UXUI designer and a freelance graphic designer.

Projects: Kolorob by Save the Children in Bangladesh, Data4Action by American Red Cross, Dhaka Mega Mapathon, Tanzania Development Trust: Kayanga Karagwe Community Mapping Project, Mlalo Lushoto Missing Buildings and numerous more projects.
