Rob is currently the Director of the Signal Program for Human Security and Technology at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. He has spent most of his career in humanitarian response and international development, spanning across startups, government, finance, and academia. Prior to his current role, he was Lead Technologist for USAID’s Global Development Lab, Officer in the World Bank Innovations Lab, and COO of Ushahidi. He was an early member of HOT, contributing to some of the earliest work in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, and has been amazed to watch HOT grow under inspired leadership and through its incredible community. He brings to the board a deep perspective of larger institutions across many sectors and an understanding of their expectations and needs, and through that helping ensure that HOT's efforts are valued and adopted at these levels. That effort means more consistent output, more transparent practices, and there by making sure to find the means to continue to support this community.
