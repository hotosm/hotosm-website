Pete is currently the Coordinator of a Research and Innovation Team for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and previously launched and coordinated the Missing Maps Project, also for MSF. He was a big fan of OSM as a user first (OSMAnd when travelling) and then as a mapper when he found HOT. He is interested in innovation and human centred design, project management, mapping, community building, communications and operations. 
As a member of the HOT board, he tries to ensure that real impact for humanitarian organisations and local communities is at the heart of everything we do. In his second term on the board, he hopes to make HOT more effective, sustainable and impactful and to better engage with and take advantage of the skills, experience and passion that exists within the board and the voting membership.
