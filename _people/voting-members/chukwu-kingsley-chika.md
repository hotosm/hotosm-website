I am Kingsley Chika CHUKWU - I am a Remote Sensing Specialist, Geospatial Analyst, Data Scientist, and Researcher.

I discovered OpenStreetMap on December 5, 2017, and since then, my passion for Geospatial data has driven me to actively contribute to a global mapping initiative with a strong focus on humanitarian service. The platform not only allowed me to be part of resilient communities but also ignited a deep motivation within me to make a positive impact on people's lives.
Over the years, I have initiated several projects and played an integral role in various aspects of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's (HOT) initiatives and projects. Through persistent participation and contributions, I was honored with a nomination to become a member of HOT in May 2020. This recognition has further propelled me to contribute extensively to HOT projects, holding roles such as HOT Global Trainee, Validator, and HOT Data Quality intern in 2022.
My passion for mapping has led to significant achievements, with over half a million edits to date. Looking ahead, my goal is to become the highest contributor, bringing immense satisfaction knowing that my contributions have played a crucial role in providing humanitarian solutions.
I am committed not only to mapping but also to mentorship and building a community of mappers. Currently, I am dedicated to training other OSMites, fostering collaboration, and sharing my knowledge to empower fellow contributors. I envision a future where I can continue contributing to OpenStreetMap, utilizing Remote Sensing and Geospatial Techniques to create a safer world. In the words of Ralph Aytoun, I believe that as long as my sight and strength permit, I will never cease contributing to OpenStreetMap, driven by a genuine love for the impactful solutions it provides.
