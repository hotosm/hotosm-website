I am Nikkon Balial, currently based in New Delhi, India. I have worked across program coordination and management roles in NGOs, social enterprises, start-ups, and international organizations. I am a motivated professional with research, M&E, and Partnerships skills. 
I have also worked globally in fields of gender equality, conflict research, and peacebuilding for organizations based in the US, Europe, and India. I am passionate about humanitarian work, and community development and look to creating more impact through the work I do. I hold a masterâ€™s in International Relations from Central European University and have a weird obsession with cooking, baking, and grocery shopping!
