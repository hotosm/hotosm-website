Working on projects focused on social and environmental issues in the lower stretch of the São Francisco river since 1997, Carlos Eduardo is a designer, builder and navigator of multihull sailing and motor vessels.

In 1998 he joined the group who founded Canoa de Tolda – Sociedade Socioambiental do Baixo São Francisco, the oldest NGO in the region, on the border of the states of Sergipe and Alagoas. Canoa de Tolda carries out its first project, coordinated by Carlos, restoring the historic Luzitânia, the oldest traditional vessel in the São Francisco river basin, a national historic and artistic heritage. In 1998 Carlos coordinated the first mapping of small riverside communities of Baixo São Francisco, the Margens project, preparing manual field sketches for the assembly of a database associating people, their residences and locations.

Carlos also launched the project for the Mato da Onça Reserve, one of only six protected areas in the Baixo São Francisco, and then created InfoSãoFrancisco, an independent collaborative geojournalism platform, to publicize the difficult reality of the region. In 2021, the MapSãoFrancisco project is launched in cooperation with UFAL – Federal University of Alagoas and with the support of HOT.
