I am a French geographer who has lived in Mexico City for half part of my life, as an urban studies researcher and open data and civic technology activist through OpenStreetMap and other citizen science projects focused on urban mobility, gender, and community building like Geochicas. I have participated in various open governance programs at the university, at the World Resources Institute, and in two federal scientific institutions in Mexico (CONACyT and INEGI). I am involved as much as my time allows in diversity and inclusion activities within OSM.
I have been a project manager for HOT in Latin America since 2021 and am now the Senior Manager of Community Programs for Latin America.
