I am a GIS Analyst with experience in research, planning, monitoring and evaluation in both the public and private  sectors,  with  a  background  in  Geographical  Information  Systems  (GIS)  and  Remote  Sensing. Further, I am a specialist in spatial analysis of local population dynamics using Census and Survey data.

My professional experience has exposed me to mainstreaming of cross cutting issues such as education, health, migration, urbanization and sanitation into research for effective organizational performance and has driven my passion of serving for sustainable development. My research interests are in Agriculture, Food Security, GIS, Remote Sensing and Artificial Intelligence.
