Raja have 24 years of working experience with environmental organizations, humanitarian and development organizations, a government-managed climate change trust fund, and donor-funded projects. In the last 14 years, he has focused on climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. He has worked on a wide range of topics related to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction at the national and community level. 

Raja earned a bachelor's degree from IPB University in Marine and Technology Science, and a master's degree from Wageningen University Research Centre (WUR) with a thesis on learning of farmers attending climate field school. Guided with motivation to introduce maritime weather forecasts to fishermen, he fundraised, designed, and led an initiative to communicate the forecast to fishermen via short-message service (SMS) in five locations and to document their learning. In the last three years, Raja has remotely provided consulting services for several organizations in conducting scoping and feasibility study on climate change adaptation and on nature-based climate solutions. He just completed in May 2023 a study report on loss and damage for Mercy Corps Indonesia.
