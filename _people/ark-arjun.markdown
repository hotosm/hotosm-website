I’m Arjun Gangadharan a.k.a. Ark Arjun, a Geospatial, Civil engineer from Palakkad, in the valley of the Western Ghats in the south of India. I do blogs about OSM and Mapping. I am a trainer of  OSM and used to conduct many training and mapping parties for the newbies. I am an active member of the OSMKerala community and OSM India.

I started out working in the Civil Engineering field after my UG, working across India and Saudi Arabia, but have been fortunate enough to be able to pursue my passion in Geospatial technology after completing Master of Technology.

I volunteer at OpenStreetMap since 2012, Wikipedia and [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (SMC)](https://smc.org.in/), and I am part of various FOSS projects. I am a comrade of Open Data, Free & Open Source Software and also advocates for it. I am one of the proud founding member of [Open Data Kerala](https://opendatakerala.org/) Movement. I am also the co-founder of [GeoMinds](https://arkives.in/about/geominds.in).
