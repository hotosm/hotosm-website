I have been contributing on open data and mapping since 2018. After years of mapping experience in 44 countries, I was interested in validating as well. I became member of HOT Global Validator, Validator trainee, MSF Validators, UN Mapper and also project creating role in Geomatics Engineering Society(GES). I have been actively involved in mapping and validating on several projects that contributes for pre and post disaster assessment, poverty alleviation and the projects which supports sustainable development goals. I have been mapping in Nepal almost every day since 2019 and during my HOT Data quality internship, I mostly mapped Zambia to support local impact governance activities. And after this internship as well, I am happily contributing almost everyday for various projects all over the world.
