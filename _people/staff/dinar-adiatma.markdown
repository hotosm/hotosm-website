Before joining HOT Indonesia in October 2016, I was involved as a GIS research assistant funded by Seameo Biotrop and I also worked as field surveyors. I was graduated from the Department of Forest Resources Conservation and Ecotourism from the Faculty of Forestry, Bogor Agricultural University with a focus on environmental spatial analysis. I have always loved the anjangsana, planted fruit trees, and outdoor scientific activities.
