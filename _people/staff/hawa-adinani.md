I am an aspiring human geographer currently working at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and a master's candidate in Public Health. I have over 8 years of experience in the open geospatial data field, community mapping, partnerships, and communication. Previously, I served as the Programs Director at OpenMap Development Tanzania, managing teams, overseeing project implementation, donor relations, and fostering partnerships. I also served as a communications specialist at the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team in Tanzania during the implementation of the Ramani Huria Project

I am passionate about open mapping for humanitarian action and have been involved with OpenStreetMap and HOT since 2015.
