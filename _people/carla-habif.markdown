I joined the Community Team at HOT as a Community Services Associate in March 2022, being passionate about humanitarian work and believing that community centered projects are the best way to develop sustainable changes in the world. 

My background is very diverse. I have a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in History and began to work as an educator. Very early in my career I realized that I wanted my work to have a social impact, so I participated and coordinated projects - in Brazil and abroad - that aimed to promote intercultural dialogue, acting as a facilitator and a conflict mediator. 

A while ago I decided I wanted to act directly in the humanitarian area, so I became a PhD candidate in International Relations and joined two Brazilian NGOs as a volunteer, working in the field with communities around the country that face severe poverty conditions. Finding meaning and purpose with humanitarian work, as well as understanding that community centered approaches are the best way to empower communities and develop sustainable changes, I joined HOT, hoping to contribute to the organization's amazing work.
