Bernard works as the Program Associate for the Asia Pacific Hub at HOT. He has a wealth of experience in sustainable development, having worked with UN-Habitat to bring sustainable planning to humanitarian contexts, and the Foreign Service in developing stronger bilateral relations. 

As a strong advocate for meaningful participation, Bernard is excited to bring his experiences in sustainable development to support OSM programmes in Asia Pacific. He looks forward to seeing how OSM will evolve as a platform-for-all as it continues to accommodate diverse stakeholders.
