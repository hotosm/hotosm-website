My name is Atikur Rahman, I am originally from Bangladesh and working as GIS Assistant for Bangladesh Open Innovation Lab (BOIL) and Community member of OSM Bangladesh. I have been contributing since 2015 by OpenStreetMap for HOT and other humanitarian organizations.

I start mapping as a contributor and field mapper for OpenMapKit tool testing and vulnerability assessment for Dhaka City which is shortly known “Data4Action”  implemented by American Red Cross in 2015.  After that I contributed lot of map data by using many tools which are developed and maintenance by HOT. In 2020 I joined HOT community working group and sometime I attend working group meetings. And I was also HOT Data Quality Intern-2021.
