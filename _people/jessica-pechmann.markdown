Jessie is currently working with HOT as interim programs manager and is responsible for supporting and overseeing Programs country teams and projects globally. 

Jessie comes to HOT with over 10 years experience in geospatial technology across the public and humanitarian sectors. Immediately previous to HOT, Jessie worked to build IMPACT Initiatives’s GIS portfolio in the Middle East. In Syria, Jessie brought spatial data analysis and mapping tools to humanitarian and rapid needs assessments in Eastern Ghouta, Idleb, and northeast Syria. Jessie later managed IMPACT’s GIS and data team in Iraq, localizing the team and doubling the team’s capacity. Before IMPACT, Jessie was a GIS Project Manager for local government in the US. 

Jessie loves working with people to incorporate data and mapping into their work to improve workflows and data visualizations. Nothing can tell a story better than a map! She holds a BA in Anthropology from Beloit College, and a Professional Master of Science and Technology with an emphasis in GIS from the University of Utah.
