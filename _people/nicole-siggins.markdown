Nicole is the Senior Associate for Corporate Virtual Volunteering on the Partnerships team. While officially joining the HOT team in 2022, sheâ€™s been an active volunteer for a number of years, including in the Community Working Group, and as a volunteer/trainer with Missing Maps London. She is a total map nerd and loves public transportation maps the best.

In her spare time, she can be found knitting, hiking, going to art museums and film festivals, and hanging out with her beloved dog, Yuki. She currently lives in Hamburg, Germany.
