Edgar is a map-maker and civic technologist with a background in Environmental Science, Policy and Management. He has been working for more than 10 years to innovate public service across institutions – public, private, multilateral, and community-based – through the deployment of open geospatial software to improve the technical capacities of local governments, bridge the data gap, and build climate change resiliency. He has been involved with OSM and community mapping projects in Mexico since 2012 and throughout the Latin America and Caribbean region since 2017, fostering the democratization of geographic information technologies, knowledge exchange and collaborative initiatives such as hackerspaces.
