Mar is the Senior Communications Strategist at HOT's Latin America and the Caribbean Hub, bringing with her over 6 years of experience in regional and global communication. 

A digital activist hailing from the central region of México, Querétaro, Mar's professional journey has seen her navigate the fields of the public and private sectors, academia, and civil society. She has spearheaded social projects encompassing civic technology, peace culture, education, citizen participation, gender equality, and cybersecurity. Notable collaborations include Code for All, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Mozilla Festival.

Beyond her professional pursuits, Mar finds solace in nature, considering hiking and communing with trees as therapeutic. She is also engaged in the art of getting lost in every city she visits, discovering new corners, and unravelling untold stories hidden within the ordinary.
