Honey Fombuena
Geographic Information Systems Associate – Asia Pacific

Honey is the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Associate for Asia at HOT. She graduated from the University of the Philippines Diliman with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geodetic Engineering. After a year of being involved in OSM Mapping through her affiliation with the UPRI Youth Mappers, she was able to join HOT Philippines as a Junior Spatial Data Entry Staff (and later on a Data Validation Lead) to the PhilAWARE Project. Honey worked for the Manila Observatory before coming back to HOT in its Asia Pacific Hub. She is passionate about utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) methods and technologies to create geospatial products that will be beneficial to the community – especially to the underrepresented and marginalized.
