Tyler currently serves as HOT's Executive Director. He joined HOT in April 2015 after 12 years leading diverse, people-focused, technology and data-enabled projects across the public, private, nonprofit, and international humanitarian sectors for organizations such as the American Red Cross, Save the Children, the United Nations Secretariat, and for Fortune 500 firms as a private sector consultant with Deloitte Consulting. In his role at HOT, Tyler oversees a team of 80 staff deployed globally and works to engage and coordinate the efforts of thousands of HOT disaster mapping volunteers for projects in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Prior to joining HOT, Tyler led the American Red Cross Hurricane Sandy (New York) community disaster recovery strategy development and implementation and directed a team of community recovery specialists engaging affected residents and community organizations on the ground. Before joining the Red Cross, Tyler worked in a number of post-disaster and community development contexts in the U.S. and internationally. He taught in Metropolitan College of New York's Emergency Management Program, and developed training curriculum in religious and cultural competency in disaster for the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.
