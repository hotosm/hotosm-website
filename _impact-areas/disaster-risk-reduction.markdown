summary: Preparedness, anticipatory action, risk reduction; and responding to the
  impacts of rapid onset and prolonged natural disasters.
block-1:
  intro: Climate related events such as severe weather, floods, prolonged drought,
    wildfires, sea level rise, and other hazard (including earthquakes) are increasingly
    impacting vulnerable populations. As communities and organizations work towards
    a more resilient future, Open map data is critical to understanding risk and taking
    anticipatory action to mitigate the impact of disasters, intended-outcomes.
  sub-block:
    title: Open Mapping in Disasters & Climate Resilience
    points:
    - title: 'Awareness, preparedness & mitigation: Anticipatory Action, Early Action,
        & Disaster Risk Reduction'
      summary: Identify spatial trends between environmental and societal risk factors
        to understand and act on vulnerabilities.
      subs:
      - title: Societal factors
        points:
        - Vulnerable infrastructure in at risk areas - buildings, services, etc.
        - Critical response information such as evacuation routes
        - Health facilities and trauma centres, etc
      - title: Environmental factors
        points:
        - Predicted areas of natural hazard risk for floods, wildfires, and geologic
          hazards
        - Climate related trends such as drought, severe storms, soil degradation
          and other changing weather patterns
    - title: Response & Recovery
      summary: ''
      subs:
      - title: Identify and fill data gaps on maps needed in response
        points:
        - Basic infrastructure - transportation, shelter, etc
        - Evacuations, Health support, Food and water availability
      - title: Locate impacted areas based on populated areas and supporting damage
          assessments
        points: 
block-2:
  title: Example Spatial Analyses
  points:
  - 'Disaster risk assessments: areas most prone and impacted by disaster.'
  - Understanding of preparedness of infrastructure, including building material,
    mitigation infrastructure, etc.
  - Post disaster damage assessments & mapping
  - Logistic prioritization, access, etc for humanitarian aid supply and delivery
  - Identification of livelihoods and basic services impacted by a changing climate
block-3:
  heading: HOT Projects in Disasters & Climate Resilience
  subheading: Disaster Services Activations at HOT
  sections:
  - heading: See also
    points:
    - Displacement & safe migration for prolonged displacement due to natural hazards
      (ie drought).
    - Public Health and Sustainable Cities & Communities for general infrastructure
      that might be impacted in a disaster.
  - heading: Coming soon (by January 2023)
    points:
    - Example OSM data models for disaster response
    - Example OSM data models for climate resiliency
    - Example methodologies and tools used for analysis in this area
    - Guidance on climate related SDG monitoring using OSM
    - Measurements on OSM data quality requirements needed for work in this area
