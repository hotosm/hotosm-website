summary: Accessible healthcare infrastructure and informed public health programming
  and monitoring.
block-1:
  intro: Challenges to a community’s public health are impacted by unequal access
    to healthcare, environmental factors, and lifestyle demands of populations with
    vulnerabilities. Better maps on healthcare infrastructure and services, as well
    as maps on environmental factors and survey data related to health can be used
    to improve access to public health and health programming.
