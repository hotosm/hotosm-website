Intro text: |-
  Historically, women and gender-diverse people have been underrepresented in the mapping community. Increasing their inclusion in mapping activities and focusing on gender-sensitive tagging can lead to a map that more accurately represents the world around us, which leads to more equitable outcomes. That is why we strive to enable gender-focused projects that directly speak to gendered issues in the disaster and humanitarian sector, as well as integrate gender-sensitive data across the rest of our [Impact Areas](https://www.hotosm.org/impact-areas/) to improve the quality of life for communities vulnerable to disasters or experiencing poverty.

  This fund is vested in HOT’s approach toward localization and community grant-making, and we expect to raise **$5 million US Dollars** from transformational gifts from foundations, institutions, and individual donors, which will be strategically aligned with local, female, and gender-diverse led mapping projects throughout our [four regional hubs:](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) Latin America and the Caribbean; East and South Africa, West and North Africa; and Asia Pacific.

  Title: Our goals
  Text: 'The Fund''s purpose is to map together with women and gender non-conforming
    people living in communities vulnerable to a wide variety of impacts. We aim for
    them to have access to teams, tools, data, and resources dedicated to humanitarian
    action and community development through open mapping. This will foster disaster
    management, risk reduction, and resilient and sustainable practices that center
    their concerns. '
