Through 2017-18, input into this plan was gathered through multiple methods: face-to-face board and staff meetings, two HOT Summits, and via a Working Group comprised of HOT voting members. HOT voting members also reviewed and commented on the draft output document.

This Strategic Plan document represents the collective vision of HOT’s voting members, Board, staff team, and community at large. Input from partner organizations is also incorporated into the plan. We hope you enjoy reading it and are reminded of the change we aim to achieve!
