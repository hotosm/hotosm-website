Intro Text: |
  In 2017, the HOT community and NGO set out a goal to produce a working, flexible plan to guide, but not dictate, the global community’s activities through 2021 and beyond. Through 2017-18, input was gathered through multiple methods: face-to-face board and staff meetings, two HOT Summits, and via a Working Group comprised of HOT voting members. HOT voting members also reviewed and commented on the draft output document.

  This Strategic Plan document represents the collective vision of HOT’s voting members, Board, and staff team. Input from partner organizations is also incorporated into the plan. We hope you enjoy reading it and are reminded of the change we aim to achieve!
