The last [MapSwipe](https://mapswipe.org/en/index.html). project for the South Sudan GIM Initiative on COVID-19 equitable vaccine distribution is nearly done. This will give us an accurate representation of where dwellings are located across the entire Western Equatoria State. With this, we will continue to make mapping projects for the Tasking Manager pinpointing where buildings and roads need to be digitized. 
<br><br>

The AWG has been monitoring two cyclones that ultimately did not originate support needs and will be archived. Another cyclone —Koguma— impacted Southeast Asia and is being monitored in case gaps are found and we can help in the response there.
