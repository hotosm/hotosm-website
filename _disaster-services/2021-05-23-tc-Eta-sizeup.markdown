Felix, I'm adding you on here as I wasn't sure you follow the AWG mailing list but I know you have some connections and
interest in Nicaragua, where Eta is set to make landfall. If you can initiate contact with the local community that is great,
or if you can pass along some contact(s) to me, we can take it from there.
