We have been working on a preparedness campaign with AmeriGEO, NOAA and the OGC and this week was scheduled as a multi-day mapathon and conference to showcase PeruSat and the capabilities of utilizing the imagery in workflows such as ours. Edgar Lemus from the HOT Partnerships team has been spearheading the effort. Yesterday, while mapping the area around Piura, Peru an area directly adjacent suffered from a large landslide so we immediately began trying to pinpoint the area and create projects.

Edgar has created two projects (one for buildings, and one for roads & waterways) that cover the impacted area. It is very rural but landslides in this area are known to cut off isolated dwellings and small settlements making response and aid efforts difficult. For now these projects are set for Advanced mappers as we'd like to be able to deliver high quality data on the first pass without much need for validation.
