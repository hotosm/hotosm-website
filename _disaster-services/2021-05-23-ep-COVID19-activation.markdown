To the amazing HOT staff(including key volunteers ‐ you know who you are) and lurkers in the Activation Working
Group, What a strange time it is, but if you look back to the last major pandemic that struck the human population in 1918.
What an amazing thing it is to be able to quickly identify thedisease and take incredible, and difficult, measures to
reduce the impact in basically every corner of the planet.

After careful consideration and deliberation, we have now decided that it is time todo our part. Please take a moment to
review this COVID‐19 size‐up (note: it may be a bit of a 'living document' for a short while as things are still rapidly
evolving): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dphv7‐h‐NSBdJO2TskwoN1PXES2Q9PBUE5ii3Gz3CA/edit?usp=sharing

Then, stay tuned as weidentify what needs we have internally; but for those in the Activation Working Group who would
like to be part of the coordination team; a) make sure you have completed the course work for the role(s) you are
interested in performing and b) let me know directly that you are interested, and what your general availability looks
like for 1 month, 3 months, and 'beyond 3months'. We won't necessarily need to build a team for longer thana month or
so, but we just aren't sure. I will be putting together an availability chart/roster for AWG volunteers.
