<h2>Context</h2>

"Following the takeover of power by the Taliban, humanitarian access is opening in some areas allowing limited delivery of assistance to resume but remains extremely challenging. Gaps and delays in assistance may lead to further deterioration of the dire humanitarian situation.

[...]

Between 1 January and 9 August 2021, an estimated 558,123 people have been internally displaced by conflict in Afghanistan, with 32 out of 34 provinces recording some level of forced displacement (source: OCHA, 23 August). Between 1 January and 19 August 2021, IOM has recorded 759,046 undocumented Afghan returnees from Iran (752,013) and Pakistan (7,033)."

<h2>Size-up Details</h2>

The following is a size-up of the situation unfolding in the South/Central Asia Region. As a dynamic event, we are still looking at what we can/should do to support the movement of people in and out of Afghanistan. Please consider this only a statement of what we are considering, not a guarantee what, if anything, we will do to assist aid organizations in the region. It also does not mean we will do any mapping in any particular country but that we are assessing what mapping can be done that eases suffering of those displaced.
