Here is the size‐up for an upcoming campaign in South Sudan. The focus of this campaign is the creation of critical
baseline data that will be used to support efficient and equitable in‐country vaccine delivery.
<br>
<h2><strong>Event Name:</strong> COVID Vaccination Campaign, Pilot ‐ South Sudan</h2>
<br>
<strong>Type of Event:</strong> Protracted Crisis
The COVID‐19 pandemic in South Sudan qualifies as a protracted crisis. Limited testing capacity has made it difficult to
ascertain the full extent of the pandemic in the country. The data that will be created from this activation will be critical
to the successful distribution of an estimated 732,000 doses of vaccine. In addition, the negative effects of previous and
concurrent disaster events have compounded upon each other and those of the pandemic. Ongoing conflict since 2013
between armed actors has displaced a significant portion of the population, acute flooding in the past year has displaced
hundreds of thousands more, and severe locust swarms have precipitated widespread food insecurity.

<strong>Location:</strong> South Sudan, Africa

<strong>Geographic Scope:</strong> Western Equatoria, South Sudan
Western Equatoria is a state located in the Southwest portion of South Sudan.

<strong>Estimated Humanitarian Impact:</strong>
1,619,000 people residing in an area approximately equal to 79,350 square kilometers.

<strong>Estimated Duration:</strong>
The pilot will conclude end‐of‐April.

<strong>Local Leads:</strong>
HOT is in contact with a microgrant community from South Sudan. They are currently based in Uganda and HOT will
consult with them as much as able.

<strong>Need for Activation:</strong>
It is a certainty that a full official activation will be undertaken as HOT is a contributing partner of the COVID Vaccination
Campaign(s) initiative. The success of this pilot project will determine the extent of similar open mapping activities being
conducted for other countries facing similar circumstances.

<strong>Estimated Data Needs:</strong>
The higher priority road system is essentially complete, but the larger roadnetwork would still benefit from the addition
of minor roads hosting smaller amounts of residential and commercial traffic. These are the roads that do not serve a
connecting function between communities. In contrast, a majority of the structures and residences in Western Equatoria
have not yet been mapped. On the Humanitarian Data eXchange, There are a number of datasets that seem promising
for future use. These include information for health facilities in the country, migration, displacement, and settlement
population data. There are also datasets about employment and food insecurity. As far as imagery is concerned, Maxar
is seemingly the most up‐to‐date. In many other areas of Western Equatoria Maxar and ESRI are virtually identical, except Maxar has better resolution. Gaps in imagery coverage exist. The Gaps that I encountered in my review of the
area will not hinder mapping efforts.

<strong>Estimated Capacity to Assist:</strong>
HOT is a contributing partner of the COVID Vaccination Campaign(s) initiative, and Employees and activators are already
preparing for upcoming activation activities. HOT's current activator capacity to lead the response is good. In tandem
with partner organizations, areas of immediate impact have already been determined, and supporting events such as Mapathons are in the process of being organized.
