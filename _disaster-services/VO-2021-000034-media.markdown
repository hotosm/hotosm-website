The Caribbean island of Saint Vincent has declared a red alert and issued an evacuation order for northern areas after seismologists warned that the La Soufrière volcano due to La Soufrière Volcano. The Volcano has been increasingly active since November. On Monday, April 5th, researchers from the University of the West Indies reported that its monitoring station had detected a “swarm of small volcano-tectonic earthquakes”, which increased steadily in magnitude. NEMO report that it has seen ash plumes of up to 8 kilometres high, and ash has also been found at that Argyle International Airport roughly 19 km to the south.
