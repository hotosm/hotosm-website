TC Elsa has started to impact the Caribbean. Currently it is difficult to know where it might have a significant impact that we may need to respond for. I am thinking the biggest need (i.e. area not well mapped on OSM that is in direct path) is Cuba but you never know if these storms might make a big turn; it is about 3 days away from Cuba still. It is also likely to at least clip Haiti around July 4th and potentially Dominican Republic which is rather sparsely mapped compared to its neighbor. Therefore, I don't think we are ready to launch any response yet. It is also the weekend (and a holiday in the US) so I will likely be delayed in my ability to support, but I'm sure you all will be able to respond if things get bad.
