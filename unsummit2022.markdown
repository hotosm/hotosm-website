    *“Our primary goal was to have HOT as part of the event since they share the same OSM and OSGeo community ideals. I really liked the 2022 SotM and FOSS4G organization and believe it should be continued in the future, with a closer relationship of the three communities, something like federated events or similar. HOT is providing a great help in organization and supporting people from low-middle income countries that should be one of the main targets of the audience.”*

  Text: "*“Thank you for this opportunity! Without HOT it would have been impossible
    for us to achieve our dream to be together again and dream of the future of our
    impact on Brazilian favelas. At this event we worked together as one TETO BRASIL,
    we shared experiences and most of all, we spent quality time with the ones that
    make everything happen. As we say: ‘COMECOU NAO PARA! We won't stop until poverty
    ends in Brazilian favelas!’ And of course we would love to count with HOT next
    year!!”* \n\n- Organizing Committee, Teto Brasil annual gathering + Cidade em
