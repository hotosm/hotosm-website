  Header: Open Source
  Text: Open source is at the heart of the HOT Community. We create and build open
    source tools and run our projects with an open source ethos. If you are interested
    in using our tools or contributing, you can access all our code, documentation,
    and other resources on GitHub.

    Tasking Manager. You can volunteer your time to active mapping projects and support
    organizations in need of map data around the world. Check out OpenMapKit for field
    based editing of OpenStreetMap. In low-bandwidth or disconnected environments,
    Field Papers can be used for paper-based data capture and POSM can be used for
    offline OSM editing. RapiD is an editor that uses Artificial Inteligence to detect
    unmapped roads and buildings.

    countries with active disaster or crisis responses are also available via HDX.
