## Selection Criteria for conferences

**Alignment**
The conference should align closely with the goals, objectives, and themes of the HOT OpenSummit. It should demonstrate a clear connection to open mapping or humanitarian/development work relevant to open mapping. Priority will be given to conferences that align with [HOT’s regional](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) hubs priorities and programmes.

**Relevance**
The conference should be highly relevant to the humanitarian and social+tech development open mapping community, addressing current challenges, trends, and advancements in the field. It should provide valuable insights, knowledge sharing, and opportunities for collaboration.

**Local Organizing Committee**
The local organizing committee (LOC) should demonstrate their ability and experience in successfully organizing conferences. This includes their track record, capacity, and resources to deliver a high-quality event.
Impact and Reach. The conference's potential impact, both in terms of the number of attendees and its influence on the open mapping community, will be considered. Priority may be given to conferences in HOT priority countries to maximize impact in those regions.

**Funding**
The conference should have other sources of funding or sponsorship to cover its budgetary needs.

**Inclusivity**
Consideration should be given to the inclusivity of the community event, ensuring that it provides opportunities for diverse participation, representation, and perspectives within the open mapping community.

Examples of previous conferences include: State of the Map Asia, State of the Map Tanzania, and the [Pacific Geospatial Conference](https://osgeo-oceania.org/pacific-geospatial-conference/).
