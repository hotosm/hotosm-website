## Selection Criteria for Community Events

**Alignment**
The event should align closely with the goals, objectives, and themes of the HOT OpenSummit. It should demonstrate a clear connection to open mapping or humanitarian/development work relevant to open mapping. Priority will be given to events that align with [HOT’s regional hubs](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) priorities and programmes.

**Movement Building **
The event should actively foster collaboration and collective action within the open mapping community. It should facilitate the exchange of experiences, best practices, and lessons learned, nurturing a sense of community and shared purpose.

**Value to Communities**
The community event should provide tangible value to the communities that HOT supports/wants to support. It should contribute to their capacity building, skill development, knowledge sharing, and relationship building within the context of humanitarian open mapping.

**Feasibility**
The community event should demonstrate its feasibility in terms of organization, resources, and logistics. Although smaller-scale events are considered, they should have a clear plan, budget, and commitment to delivering a successful event.
