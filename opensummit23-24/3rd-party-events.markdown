## Selection Criteria for 3rd Party Events

**Alignment**
The conference should align closely with the goals, objectives, and themes of the HOT OpenSummit. It should demonstrate a clear connection to open mapping or humanitarian/development work relevant to open mapping. Priority will be given to conferences that align with [HOTâ€™s regional hubs](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) priorities and programmes.

**Audience Reach**
The collaboration should have the potential to reach new and / or relevant audiences who may not be familiar with the potential application of open mapping and open data. It should explore creative and innovative ways to engage with these audiences and raise awareness about open data, mapping technologies, and their humanitarian applications.

**Collaboration Potential**
The event should have potential to foster collaboration and partnerships, both within the open mapping community and with external stakeholders. It should create opportunities for dialogue, networking, and knowledge exchange.
Impact. The event should have potential impact on promoting open data awareness, advocacy, and collaborations/partnerships should be considered. Emphasis can be placed on interventions in non-traditional open mapping spaces and those targeting map user audiences.

**Inclusivity**
Consideration should be given to the inclusivity of the community event, ensuring that it provides opportunities for diverse participation, representation, and perspectives within the open mapping community.
