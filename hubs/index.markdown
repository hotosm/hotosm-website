  Title: Eastern & Southern Africa
  Text: |-
    <strong>The Open Mapping Hub - Eastern and Southern Africa</strong> works with organizations and communities across 23 countries in creating and updating free, editable and shareable open map data in OpenStreetMap. We believe that open map data is universal and contributes to identifying problems, monitoring change, managing and responding to events, forecasting, setting priorities and understanding humanitarian and development trends.
    <br /><br />We envision a future where all people in Eastern and Southern Africa have the opportunity to contribute to and use open mapping processes and open data in their everyday lives.

  Title: LATAM Hub
  Text: "<strong>The Open Mapping Hub - Latin America and the Caribbean</strong> is
    transitioning from its “Alpha Phase” -a stage in which we have carried out activities
    to support the objectives of HOT, communities and other open mapping actors of
    the region, co-designing this way what an Open Mapping Hub at the service of Latin
    America can be and do- to the Hub as such, having formed a solid network of relationships
    at different levels throughout the region, a group of projects carried out or
    in progress that demonstrate the value that the Hub can bring to communities,
    as well as some collaboration models that can be optimized in the immediate future."
