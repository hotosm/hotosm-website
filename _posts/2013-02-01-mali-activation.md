<h2>Priority areas</h2>

<a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/#all/Mali">Tasking Manager jobs for Mali</a> are already defined. This crowdsourcing approach assures coordination of mapping by numerous contributors.

These tasks have been defined to respond  to priority areas expressed by humanitarians and OCHA. Highest priority was expressed for for Bamako, Segou, Mopti, Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal .  We will be mapping many of the standard OpenStreetMap priorities, including roads, airports, waterways, buildings and landuse areas. In addition we are asked to contribute to support in <a href="http://cod.humanitarianresponse.info/about">Common and Fundamental Operational Datasets (COD/FOD)</a>.

<h2>Volunteers with local knowledge</h2> 

We are looking for volunteers to geolocate facilities in infrastructure described in datasets provided by our partners.
