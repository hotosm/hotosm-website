<p><strong>Emir Hartato</strong>,22, has been working on the HOT Indonesian team since June 2011. During his senior year at the <strong>University of Indonesia</strong>, Emir (along with Vasanthi) joined HOT as an intern. Kate Chapman, Jeff Haack, Vasanthi Harygono and Emir were the initial four to teach OSM under HOT. He has traveled extensively throughout Indonesia teaching OpenStreetMap to government workers, NGOs and other humanitarian organizations. <!--break--><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/emr_0_0.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="296"></p><p>Emir lives in the rainy city of Bogor (outside Jakarta) and enjoys taking elaborate photos. Here is what he has to say about his work with HOT so far:</p><p><strong>How did you get involved with HOT/OSM?</strong> <br>First, in March 2011, I didn’t know exactly what is OSM until then my lecture told me that there will be a mapping project in several areas around Indonesia, I didn’t have any expectation at all. My goal at the moment was: traveling around for free? Why not? So I said that I could join that project to my lecturer. And because HOT team need 2 persons, I asked Va to join. The first OSM workshop was held in Department of Geography University of Indonesia. There were around 20 people joined for the workshop. And in the end, my lecture introduced me to Kate Chapman. Couple weeks later, me and Va received the contract and signed in for HOT pilot project in Indonesia.</p><p><strong>What had been your experience with learning/teaching OSM?</strong> <br>Well there’s a lot-interesting story until now. I’m glad that my involvement is related with my main major. I’m also glad that I can interact with local people from different area, explore things, and make friends. But, I’m also hate about flight delays, cancellation, and bad landing. There aren’t many flights to go around, most flights are not direct so we have transit from an island to another island.</p><p><strong>What are some ideas you have for expanding the OSM community? Or motivating more people to map?</strong> <br>First, before I gathering more people to use OSM, I usually told them why maps can be useful and powerful tool for anyone and any purpose. From simple things like knowing where things are, local development purpose, until disaster risk reduction.</p><p><strong>What is the greatest challenge you have with OSM?</strong> <br>Key and tags. Each people have different the way of thinking. So it’s really hard to make a standard key and tags especially in Indonesia. Same objects can have many different names. Also the way that people put the information can be different.</p><p><strong>What do you think OSM greatest strength is? </strong> <br>Community. More people mapping = the maps become more detail and beautiful. Open source. The data is available open! And you can alter in many ways with many tools to create better maps!&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/emir_0.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="493"></p><p>We look forward to seeing how the OSM maps and community will develop in Indonesia in the coming year. The work that Emir has put into creating Indonesian OSM resources and support is invaluable.Thanks, Emir!</p>
