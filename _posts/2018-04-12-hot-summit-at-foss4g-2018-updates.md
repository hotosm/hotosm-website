The time is quickly approaching! HOT Summit at FOSS4G 2018 is only 4 months away and we're excited to see you and for you to see our field programs in action in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. HOT Summit 2018 will be in conjunction with the Widening Access and Humanitarian Mapping track at the FOSS4G Conference.

Before we get there, there are lots of ways to get involved without even having to join the Summit Working Group! This year, we want your input to guide the Presentations. What do you want to know more about? What's happening right now in OSM and what's next? Have your say on the Program and be a part of the <a href="http://community-review.foss4g.org/" target="_blank">Community Review</a>.

As always, we want to help as many people get to the Summit as possible, by locating our conference in East Africa, we hope to increase access for local OSM communities. Additionally, we will provide some monetary assistance to enable participation from those for whom cost is a barrier. If you, or someone you know is in need of some support, learn more and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrs_trEGG65wG71-GyvHCsaBO8eCzOSAbfLm9YFz_Dm7TaRg/viewform" target="_blank">Apply for a Travel Grant</a>.

We've already got some spectacular <a href="http://2018.foss4g.org/sponsoring.html" target="_blank">sponsors</a> helping fund the Summit and FOSS4G 2018, but there is also an opportunity for anyone to support the Travel Grant program specifically.
