Summary Text: HOT begins to transition mapping of critical data in response to the
  Mexico Earthquakes, South Asia Floods, Caribbean Hurricanes and West Pacific Volcano
  threats back to local communities. It’s during this crucial time that we ask for
  mappers to become validators, and make an important second look to ensure the mapping
  was done as instructed.

The situation in Puerto Rico is very much still in the early phase of recovery. Clean water is not yet available on the entire island and restoring power has been a major struggle with less than half of the island restored. The good news is that the local OpenStreetMap Community was able to quickly start contributing vital information that helped the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross plan and conduct emergency relief efforts.

HOT has been managing the mapping projects with OSM-Mexico and the Mexico National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) determining which areas and features to map. There are still a few remaining projects to be mapped, and there is a lot of validation. We encourage anyone having a mapathon over </span><a href="http://osmgeoweek.org/">OSM GeoWeek</a> to consider making it a validation event - smaller groups of experienced mappers are best as validation is a bit difficult to teach to larger audiences especially with inexperienced mappers.

Or like to teach others? Validation may be something you really enjoy. It’s half cleaning up the data for the end users, like first responders and aid organizations - and it’s half perfecting new mappers abilities. Most people map, never really getting any interaction with other mappers. A friendly “hello, I see you’re new to OpenStreetMap, let me help you” can turn the discouraged newbie into the confident, proficient mapper we hope they all could become. It’s a role we are seriously short on, so whether you have been validating already, or are thinking about it but not sure - please join us in making every Friday,"<a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23validationfriday">#ValidationFriday</a>"- although any day you can do some validation, we appreciate.</p><p>We also have needs for more participation in all our <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Working_groups">Working Groups</a>; or, if you are interested in working on a disaster coordination team, please visit <a href="http://courses.hotosm.org">http://courses.hotosm.org</a>.</p>
