## What is the most interesting project you've worked on here? 

One of the most intriguing projects I've worked on at HOT is the Kakuma Kalobeyei Community Mapping Project. This project presented a unique set of challenges due to its sensitive nature and the complex dynamics in the field. The drone mapping activities involved engaging with the local community, understanding their needs and concerns, and navigating various cultural nuances. It required a delicate balance of technical expertise and interpersonal skills to map the area while respecting the community's sensitivities successfully. The project pushed me to think outside the box and find innovative solutions to address these complexities, making it an incredibly rewarding and intellectually stimulating experience.

## What fulfills you most about your role?

What fulfills me most about my role is the tangible impact I can make on communities and humanitarian causes through open mapping. Knowing that the work I do directly contributes to addressing critical challenges and improving people's lives brings a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment. Witnessing how organizations on the ground utilize our maps to plan and implement interventions and assist in emergency response efforts is incredibly rewarding. It fuels my passion for geospatial innovation and motivates me to continuously push boundaries, seeking new ways to leverage technology and data for the betterment of society.

## How have you grown professionally while in your role?

While in my role, I have grown professionally in several ways. I have honed my project management skills, learned to coordinate with volunteers from diverse backgrounds effectively, and improved my ability to navigate complex mapping projects. Additionally, I have developed a deeper understanding of the challenges and nuances of humanitarian mapping and gained valuable experience in mentoring and capacity building. These professional growth opportunities have expanded my skill set and enhanced my ability to lead and contribute effectively to the overall success of our initiatives.

## What's the motto you live by?

Innovate, adapt, conquer... and maybe throw in a few unexpected plot twists along the way! This motto encapsulates my belief in continuous learning, adaptability, and the pursuit of meaningful contributions to society.

## What are you reading right now?

I am reading "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle. It offers insights into mindfulness and living in the present moment.
