## Equipping local communities with the ability to use OSM for decision-making and providing relevant information for disaster management.


As part of the Open Mapping Hub Asia Pacific's dedication to strengthening data usage and promoting disaster resilience throughout the Asia-Pacific Region, we are collaborating with local communities and partners in Timor-Leste to provide training on OSM for Disaster Management. In collaboration with World Vision Timor-Leste, Simile Timor-Leste, and other local agencies, the training program was launched with a virtual session, followed by an in-person session where several community members and INGOs participated.
