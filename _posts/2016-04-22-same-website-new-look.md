<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Greetings HOT community,</p><p>For a few years now we have been contemplating a new look, and more importantly - improved usability, of our website <a href="http://www.hotosm.org">hotosm.org</a>. In 2015 our Technical Working Group recruited HOT Voting Member, Felix Delattre, to generally manage and facilitate website development on a volunteer basis. Since then, we have been able to better coordinate and work on things here and there to make improvement; including the much needed project pages, member profiles, and more.</p><p>Of course we kept in mind a much bigger overhaul of the site. For a while, progress remained on-hold for bigger changes but we received some much needed motivation and assistance over the last half-a-year. In December 2015, HOT welcomed Moriah Ellig, an intern with the <a href="https://hotosm.org/projects/outreachy">Outreachy</a> program who took on the task of exploring the site from the user perspective and worked alongside Felix and another HOT Voting Member, Katja Ulbert - our ‘expert design volunteer’. Over the past four months, the team worked together, gathering input from the HOT community to develop a new responsive design that works well on a variety of screen sizes.</p><p>With the redesign finalized, Felix was ready to implement the new front-end theme. Our great partners at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, who have sponsored HOT’s Outreachy interns, also generously sponsored the technical implementation of the new theme. We are very excited to share ‘the new look’ with you!</p><p><span style="font-size: 13.008px; line-height: 1.538em;">Thank you Felix, Moriah, Katja, Mapbox and all of our great community contributing to continued improvement at HOT!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 13.008px; line-height: 1.538em;">Note: if you experience any problems with the new site, or have general feedback/ideas for improvement, please log them here: <a href="https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm-website/issues%20">https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm-website/issues&nbsp;</a></span></p>
