The Open Mapping Hub Asia-Pacific (AP Hub) is offering grants to 10 Students Clubs from universities in the Asia-Pacific region. The Student Clubs Sponsorship Call is aimed at supporting the student organizations to implement OpenStreetMap (OSM) and other open mapping activities for one year to:

* Increase your membership

* Increase students’ knowledge and interest in OSM and open mapping for impact

* Expand the map in your locality

* Explore the potential to integrate OSM in the classroom and in research.

The sponsorship amount will be up to $1000 per applicant. This is a flexible fund that can be used for a wide range of OSM/open-mapping activities.

We believe that active and continuous OSM-related activities in universities are key to creating a sustainable OSM ecosystem. We envision universities and student organizations playing a key role in supporting the growth of OSM and open mapping communities where future experts meet open mapping technologies and practices for the first time. Since OMHAP aspires to catalyze OSM and open mapping research in the region, we are excited to acknowledge and support this movement.

**About OMHAP**

The Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific was established in early 2021 to advance the open mapping movement in the Asia-Pacific region, in collaboration with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). The hub engages open mapping organizations and communities in the region to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise across 25 countries in the region. We also provide financial and technical support to massively scale local edits on OpenStreetMap (OSM).

By prioritizing local mapping organizations and communities, facilitating knowledge exchange, distributing funding, and providing training and support, we are focusing efforts to work with local organizations and communities to drive high-quality, ethical, local data use cases.

**What is the Club Sponsorship?**

The Student Club Sponsorship program is open to student groups from all disciplines and departments that can potentially utilize and benefit from OSM and open mapping. These departments can be (but not limited to):

* Geomatics

* Geography

* Cartography

* Computer Sciences & Engineering

* Civil & Environmental Engineering

* Agricultural Engineering

* City & Regional Planning

* Architecture

* and others

The sponsorship can be utilized by the recipients to conduct regular OSM and open mapping related activities such as training, seminars, and workshops throughout the year. The activities should ensure the recipients are able to sustain a vibrant OSM community and open mapping activity in the coming years.

During the sponsorship period, OMHAP will provide orientation, coordination, and knowledge-sharing support to the recipient student organizations. The recipients will be required to regularly update OMHAP through coaching sessions and progress reports during the sponsorship period. In addition to that, OMHAP is also willing to discuss strategies and methods with the faculty members, if requested, to implement open mapping in the classroom, and in research.
