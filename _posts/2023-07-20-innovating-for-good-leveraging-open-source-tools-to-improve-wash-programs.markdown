Over time, there has been a rise in problems with waste disposal, public health, water quality, air pollution, and sanitation. These issues are closely connected, so any imbalance in one area can have repercussions on others. Initially, these concerns were not significant since existing technologies and human resources were able to handle them adequately. However, due to the increasing population in every country, it is becoming increasingly challenging to effectively manage these problems.

We cannot define health without WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) programs being balanced, we cannot define smart cities without them too. Clean cities, smart cities, proper waste disposal not just for attainment of SDGs but for our future generations and safe living spaces calls for more hands. It was back then when only the governments would worry and cater for WASH programs somehow effective. As knowledge continues to increase and populations double, more organizations are springing up to assist and complement the efforts of the governments. Among those prestigious organizations is the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.

HOT is an organization that works on producing open data, open sources of data, tools and platforms for open mapping, disaster response, and any other goal you may wish to attain. One other use of open map knowledge or tools is in improving WASH programs, and in that manner, the Community Working Group organized a session where we learned from open mapping communities that have at least taken part or carried out WASH projects using open map data and or tools.

The knowledge-sharing session focused on bringing to light what WASH programs are, sharing knowledge and experiences on projects that are using or have used open mapping and OSM data for WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) and solid waste management projects. The various community representatives (speakers) discussed how they have utilized these approaches to improve project planning, implementation, and monitoring in their respective contexts. This provided an opportunity to learn from experts in the field and engage in a discussion on the challenges, opportunities, and learnings when implementing such projects.

Different communities shared how they worked on their projects, lessons from the projects, challenges they encountered, and how other communities can collaborate and support other forthcoming projects on WASH. Here are some of the takeaways from the session taken from the Q&A Session:

### Q: What are some of the challenges you've experienced while implementing these projects?

* Conflict of interest especially in the area of WASH. Waste sites may also be businesses for people, so there is a feeling that we are exposing these sites. We work with the government to decide if these people can move. Ultimately, the challenge is that people protect their source of livelihood. Another thing is some facilities are not in good condition, so it’s difficult to move around in the facilities.

* Perception of the community. We worked with the government in explaining to communities that this is for their benefit.

* Getting buy-in of stakeholders (community leaders and government authorities). So, we first got the buy-in of a local NGO that already has the trust of the community and we partnered with them. We then organized town-halls with community heads and also made them nominate the local volunteers (daughters of the community). We trained these volunteers to do the Mapping under our supervision.

* For Government Authorities, we wrote letters, scheduled courtesy visits, invited them to participate in the field work, so we gave them a sense of belonging to the project.

* Another challenge was functionality of tools (implementation of a project of this magnitude and type had lots of gray areas) - We used open source tools, did a detailed feasibility study of the area of interest remotely, physically and did a Mock data Collection. Our team was a mix of experienced and skilled team mates.

### Q: How easy was it to publish your data journalism story with Guardian? That’s such a good idea.

* Partnership - Before that project, we already had a relationship with the Guardian. Also as an Organisation, we gave the story telling to the Guardian with support (mini-grant, Visualization / technical support, data support,), we took the Guardian to the field and allowed them to tell the story. That Story was built on shorthand hence the unique/interactive styling for content.
* The project was also on mainstream media like the BBC, CNN, DW, AFP, Al Jazeera, etc.

### Aside from the tools, methodology, how has the government used the data and output being used to improve people’s lives?

* Ministry of Waste and Environment. There are also NGOs who work with the data, and it is essential that we now have a map available for their use.

### If you could mobilize a million mappers around the world, what would you like them to focus on?

* Clean water. Many citizens do not understand that there is not always clean, potable water.
 
After the knowledge sharing session, the participants had a demo and walked through the OSM Wiki Editathon. Encouragement was for users to document in OSM Wiki. Users can refer to previous projects and create their own. It is also good to keep record of what has been done, how it was done for future references or other research. To keep this discussion rolling there is a [loomio thread](https://loomio.hotosm.org/d/tqxuYgKb/questions-and-feedback-wash-webinar) for everyone to comment or suggest as we continue to save the world through maps!
