Understanding these elements are useful for developing better and more effective additions to OSM. Since these workshops are all computer based and quite sedentary, we try to make the sessions fun. We have incorporated some games to learn the difference between bad and good editing. Participants divide into two groups and must put screenshots of JOSM into either the bad editing or good editing piles. Bad edits include unlabeled or misspelled tags, incomplete ways, or duplicate objects.</p><p><img src="/sites/default/files/Selection_022_0.png" alt="" width="780" height="385"></p><p>We hope that by the end of these workshops, participants develop the skills and tools needed to correct and strengthen the quality of data in OSM.</p><p><em><img class="image-large" src="/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/inter_0.jpg?itok=jHnyvtEF" alt="" width="480" height="319"><br>Our team and participants in the Bandung training.
