<p>Back when HOT started in Indonesia none of us was sure how the growth of OpenStreetMap would happen. As it stands today we've trained hundreds of people and others have picked up OpenStreetMap on their own or been trained by someone else. One of our approaches has been to create a 'Training of Trainers' program. Individuals were invited to come to Jakarta last May based on their success in our previous training programs and completion of a homework assisgnment. Since that time we've worked with these trainers while providing contingency planning support as well as kept in touch online.</p><p>Last week with the launch of InaSAFE 2.0 we brought the gang back together to learn what has changed in InaSAFE as well as discuss any pain points they were having with the technology. It is exciting to see people continue to grow with the technology as we improve the tech itself and the documentation around it. None of this would be possible without the great partners involved in Scenario Development for Contingency planning, the <a href="http://bnpb.go.id/">Indonesian Disaster Management Agency</a>, <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/">Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a> and the <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org">World Bank</a>. Together to help further spread knowledge about InaSAFE and OpenStreetMap we'll continue to create trainers in Indonesia.
