OpenMap Development Tanzania (OMDTZ) has been awarded a two-year grant by [Fondation Botnar ](https://www.fondationbotnar.org/)to support youth by giving them the power and responsibility to gain technical and social skills to leverage the full potential of frontier technologies. The program — Open Skies Fellows: African Tech for African Data — is implemented through a strong partnership with the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team ](https://www.hotosm.org/)(HOT) and [Uhurulabs](http://website.uhurulabs.org/). The partners will work together to bridge this skills gap between youth and the promise of new technologies, with the conviction that all they need are resources, time to develop, and mentorship.
