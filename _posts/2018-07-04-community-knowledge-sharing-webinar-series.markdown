Be part of the Community Knowledge Sharing Webinar series this July as we celebrate the successes of Nethope Device Challenge and HOT Microgrant communities. The goal of these webinars is for OSM communities to share their experiences, challenges and ideas on five central themes - gender, youth, advocacy, data integration and Leave No One Behind. Each webinar will have 3 communities presenting, followed by an open discussion around challenges they've faced along the road, with the goal to share learnings across community projects.
