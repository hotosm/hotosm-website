On 5th December 2023, Rebecca Firth, HOT’s Executive Director, and Mikel Maron, OSMF Director and Secretary, signed an MoU agreeing on the terms of HOT’s use of the OpenStreetMap trademark in the furtherance of [HOT’s vision](https://www.hotosm.org/hots-vision-and-values.html).

HOT is also proud to announce corporate membership in the OSMF at the silver level, and will join the OSMF Advisory Board. This is a commitment to support the OSMF in its mission, and an investment in the OpenStreetMap community and ecosystem. 

HOT would also like to acknowledge the huge amount of work that has gone into this agreement by volunteers on both boards (past and present) over the years. This milestone could not have been reached without their engagement and commitment. 

We look forward to continued collaboration in making OpenStreetMap not only the best and most accessible map of the world, but also one that supports people to improve their own lives and livelihoods in places vulnerable to humanitarian crisis and multidimensional poverty.
