Since January 2018, the Nethope grant communities have expanded to 16 communities, with plans to extend to a further 6 in the next 3 months. Grant money has already been advanced to communities Bangladesh, Botswana, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Peru, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda and Zambia, with our sixteenth community, the Gambia, beginning next week.

### Bangladesh

Bangladesh received funding in September 2017 and are involved in four projects - Map Your City, South Asian Flood Activation,  Clean Dhaka:Smart Dhaka, and NIHR Global Health Unit on Improving Health in Slums. The Map Your City aims to map all major cities in Bangladesh. So far, the team have been mapping Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Comilla, Mymensingh and Jessore. The BHOOT and OSMBD team have been supporting South Asian Flood Activation by mapping residential areas and connecting roads of affected areas to support aid agencies and improve future response mechanisms. The Clean Dhaka, Smart Dhaka project aims to create a geodatabase of waste disposal points. NIHR Global Health Unit on Improving Health in Slums is a research project identifying the location and details of medical facilities in slum areas.

### Kenya

In the last month two members of the HOT Tanzania team travelled to Kenya to conduct community mapping training and field mapping with the Kenyan NGO, the Karibu Centre, Salesforce volunteers local residents, and members of the #MapKibera project. The training was funded by Nethope as were the devices provided to continue mapping efforts. You can read more about the recent training and field mapping <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2018-04-12_mapping_to_support_local_ngos_in_kenya"> here </a> .   The Karibu Centre works with children, young people and their families to bridge the education gap in Kenya. The maps from field data collected will help improve pre-school and after-school programmes, and job readiness training for underprivileged families.

### Coming soon…

Communities in Botswana, the Gambia, Indonesia, Mozambique, Peru, and Sierra Leone have also recently received funding under the Nethope device grant. In Botswana the devices will be used to support the new HOT field country project focused on malaria prevention in conjunction with the Botswana Ministry of Health &amp; Wellness and the Clinton Health Access Initiative. In Gambia, efforts will focus on producing a base map of key social resources and public health facilities, particularly in flood prone areas to build community resilience plans. In Indonesia, HOT Indonesia have partnered with PMI (Palang Merah Indonesia) to produce disaster resilience plans through field mapping. Mapeando Meu Bairro in Mozambique will be using their devices to increase their field mapping capacity in Maputo to improve flood resilience plans for emergency responders. In Peru, the Nethope grant will be used to create a 3D cultural heritage project supported by UNESCO. OSM Sierra Leone will use the devices they purchase in collaboration with the Red Cross to map areas at risk of epidemiological crises.
