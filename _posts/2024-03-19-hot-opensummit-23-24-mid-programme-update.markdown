The HOT OpenSummit encompasses three event categories: conferences, open mapping contributions to third-party events, and community events. The program seeks to extend open mapping's reach, promote open map data awareness, and facilitate collaboration and collective action within the open mapping community. It also aims to bring together communities, partners, collaborators, and supporters to learn, share, and connect. 

**What we have achieved so far**
Five months after the launch, we collaborated with and supported 11 events, which received funding of up to 62,632 USD and reached 2,688 participants. Below are some highlights from the events that have been part of the OpenSummit program.
