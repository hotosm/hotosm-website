Since the onset of the pandemic, HOT Indonesia's training activities have been affected. To adapt, the team shifted their regular training sessions to an online training platform.

HOT Indonesia is collaborating with PPGT (a local partner from the university's research department in Universitas Indonesia)  to hold OpenStreetMap training and mapathons for the students of Department of Geography, Universitas Indonesia. The training aims to improve the students' knowledge and skills in using OpenStreetMap.

**Shifting behavior**

The [online training activities](https://edu-hotosmid-courses.odoo.com/en/) must apply different training methods that regular in-person trainings. Some materials were delivered online in three webinars and students were also required to do more self-study.

**Learning methods**

The training activities used two online platforms: Odoo and Zoom. Odoo is used to store all training materials and quizzes so the students can study on their own and Zoom is used for webinars or live class sessions so the trainer and participants can communicate interactively.

**What is Odoo?**

Odoo provides an e-learning platform that facilitates independent learning. The platform also enables communication between trainers and participants via a forum and will provide a notification when there are new training materials and quizzes.

So far, three different webinars have been held on different topics:

* Webinar I - Introduction to the Odoo Training Platform and Youthmappers

* Webinar II - Editing with JOSM and Tasking Manager

* Webinar III - OSM Data Validation and HOT Export Tool.

**Mapathon**

To apply theory and knowledge of mapping, the students took part in a mapathon in Pondok Aren sub-district. Pondok Aren is one of the areas with the highest COVID-19 cases in Banten, West Java, Indonesia. Its proximity to Jakarta makes this area more vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19.
