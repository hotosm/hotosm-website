The event brought together federal agencies, technologists, and companies to share and network on disaster technology. It was remarkable moment to reflect how far things have come in just a few years. The focus was US domestic, but one presentation slot was given to Albert Gembara from USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). Albert chose to highlight the effort of the HOT community during Typhoon Haiyan, and particularly, the OpenStreetMap Tasking Manager (which OFDA has generously supported).

So just to say to everyone, your efforts in HOT are on some high level radars. Thanks and congrats!
