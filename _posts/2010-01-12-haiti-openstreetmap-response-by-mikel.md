<p>The have been at least <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse?bbox=-72.799%2C18.316%2C-71.977%2C18.844">400 OpenStreetMap editing sessions in Haiti since the quake hit</a>. Mostly tracing Yahoo imagery, and gleaning information from old CIA maps. We also just received permission to use GeoEye imagery acquired post-event "¦ that will allow us to tag collapsed buildings. Many relief groups are deploying now, many checking in with the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/crisismappers">CrisisMappers list</a> (the main locus of the wider humanitarian tech community), and they are making inquiries into OSM data and requests for particular features. Dozens of mappers and developers are lending a hand, coordinating on the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti#2010_Earthquake_Response">OSM Haiti WikiProject</a> and IRC and the OSM talk list "¦ standing up services, including <a href="http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiti/">5 minute extracts in Shapefile and Garmin formats</a>, and <a href="http://hikebikemap.de/?zoom=13&amp;lat=18.55957&amp;lon=-72.34126&amp;layers=0B00TFFF">maps with hill-shading</a>. Just the start to relief and reconstruction effort we hope to contribute to.</p><p>Two images to show how we've progressed "¦ the first OSM Port au Prince just now, the second OSM before the earthquake.</p><p><a title="haiti.osm.20090114180900 by mikel_maron, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikel_maron/4274264771/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4274264771_6873e16fa0.jpg" alt="haiti.osm.20090114180900" style="width:500px;height:403px"></a></p><p><a title="haiti.osm.pre-event by mikel_maron, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikel_maron/4274264767/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4274264767_c9933d12c5.jpg" alt="haiti.osm.pre-event" style="width:500px;height:379px"></a></p><p>I'll be on <a href="http://twitter.com/mikel">twitter</a> with updates "¦ though I'm due to fly tonight to Ireland.</p>
