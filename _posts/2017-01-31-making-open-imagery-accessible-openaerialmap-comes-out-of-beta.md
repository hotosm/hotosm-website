<p>Open satellite and aerial imagery can be difficult to find, access and use. For HOT and our humanitarian partners, open imagery has been critical for disaster response and preparedness in places like <a href="https://hotosm.org/projects/ecuador_earthquake">Ecuador</a> and <a href="https://hotosm.org/projects/tanzania">Tanzania</a>. For the past year and a half, <a href="https://openaerialmap.org/">OpenAerialMap</a> has been providing access to openly licensed imagery for the OpenStreetMap and humanitarian community to try to make it easier. With user-friendly searching and map interactions, OAM has enabled anyone to download or contribute open imagery. Easy download access to imagery is the first step to make openly licensed imagery useable. But this only satisfies the need for advanced or experienced users. Enabling on-the-fly analysis or immediate use regardless of experience changes the way anyone can use open imagery. On Friday, we rolled out the first of new updates to OAM to enable immediate use:</p><ul><ul><li>OAM now has tiled map services (TMS and WMTS) for all uploaded imagery</li><li>users can upload non-GeoTIFF formats</li><li>imagery is now indexed available through <a href="http://www.geoportal.org/">GEOSS portal</a></li><li>...and we’ve removed the beta tag with a <a href="https://map.openaerialmap.org">new URL</a></li></ul></ul><h4>Map services for all uploaded imagery</h4><p>All imagery that is directly uploaded through OAM now has web map services available. Standards like <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts">WMTS</a> and <a href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification">TMS</a> are web services that enable seamless integration with tools like QGIS, ArcGIS, or directly into iD or JOSM for OSM tracing.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/oam-tms-dropdown.gif?itok=JsFKKy6T" alt="" style="width:480px;height:346px"></p><h4>Non-geotiff formats</h4><p>Now when you upload to OAM, you can directly upload <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000">.jp2 formatted files</a>. JPEG 2000 (JP2) is a compressed format that many drone and imagery processing software can create. It is a lightweight option for some users who need to conserve space on their local hard drive or have limited upload bandwidth. OAM now accepts submissions in JP2 format and converts them to a GeoTIFF format for storage.&nbsp;</p><h4>GEOSS Portal</h4><p>OAM is now fully available within the <a href="http://www.geoportal.org/">Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Portal</a>. As a participating member of the Group on Earth Observations, we are now also providing data within the system to enable additional search and access with other imagery and earth observation products.&nbsp;</p><h4>Out of beta at SatSummit</h4><p>We’re also announcing that we’ve officially taken off the beta tag and imagery is now accessible at https://map.openaerialmap.org. Over the past year, we’ve been working with our users and imagery providers to test and understand how to improve finding and sharing imagery. All of this work has been a part of a huge effort by our partners like <a href="https://github.com/mojodna">Seth Fitzsimmons</a>, <a href="https://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, and <a href="https://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a> along with our funders the <a href="http://dfat.gov.au/">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/">Humanitarian Innovation Fund</a>. Tyler, Cristiano, and I are at SatSummit today talking with imagery providers and global development organizations about how OAM and OpenStreetMap can be a part of the ecosystem of tools and data during disaster response or public health emergencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the new features at <a href="https://openaerialmap.org/">openaerialmap.org</a>. If you’re at SatSummit, find us during the day to hear more about the new work.</p>
