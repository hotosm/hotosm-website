# User-Friendly Website Design with Brazil Singh

Brazil is currently the President of Youthmappers Chapter at Eastern University of Bangladesh. He shared his expertise and experience in creating user-friendly website design using WordPress. He presented theoretical and step-by-step guide on how to create a website. This webinar was inspired by his passion to support Youthmappers chapters to design their own website.
