<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px; line-height: normal;"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">HOT has been developing an 'Activation' training curriculum over the last several months in order to build and improve the skills of it's 'Activators'. This was all made possible by a generous grant from the Hewlett Foundation who were inspired by the West Africa Ebola epidemic response and wanted to contribute to improving HOT's capacity to support future events</span><span style="font-size: 12.8000001907349px;">. As part of the grant and the development of the curriculum, two workshops will be held in order to train and certify activators, as well as receive first hand feedback for further improvements. The pilot workshops will take place in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Jakarta, Indonesia in September later this year. Designed as a three-day course, the participants will be guided through the on-line open curriculum, learning the necessary theory and skills it takes to support a HOT activation before engaging in a simulation where this newly gained knowledge can be put into practice.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
