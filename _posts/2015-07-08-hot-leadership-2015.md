<p dir="ltr">This year has presented many challenges to HOT. We have been incredibly active and successful in all of our programs: Disaster Mapping, Community Building and Technical Projects; maybe best demonstrated by the recent enhancements to our website, including a better presentation of all our current projects here:<a href="http://hotosm.org/projects"> http://hotosm.org/projects</a>. However, as many of you know, 2015 has been a year of tremendous change in HOT leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">As the 2014 term for the Board of Directors neared its conclusion, Founding Member and Board President, Mikel Maron, got a wonderful opportunity; unfortunately one that would require him to step down from the HOT Board. Shortly thereafter, Founding Member and first Executive Director of HOT, Kate Chapman, also made a difficult decision to take an amazing opportunity; one that would result in HOT doing a search for an Interim Executive Director while the 2015 Board Election was underway. Three other Board Members also made the tough decision to forgo another term in order to focus on other life opportunities and commitments; leaving HOT with a certain future of a majority of new members on the Board, a transition in Executive leadership and for the first time, no Founding Members in any Director position.</p><p dir="ltr">But our community is incredibly strong, just before this major transition we welcomed twenty-five new Voting Members, you can learn a little about them here:<a href="http://hotosm.org/voting-members"> http://hotosm.org/voting-members</a>. When the dust had settled, a great Interim Executive Director, Tyler Radford, was found and thrown right into action as our response to the Nepal Earthquakes had just begun and his first day on the job was day one of the HOT Summit. After a bit of a hurdle with filling all seven Board seats, I am confident the membership has selected a wonderful group of leaders to guide HOT into the future. Congratulations to: Heather Leson (President), Blake Girardot (Vice President), Jorieke Vyncke (Secretary), Jaakko Helleranta (Treasurer), Nama Budhathoki, Severin Menard and Dale Kunce.</p><p dir="ltr">And a humble bow for allowing me to serve again as Chairperson for the Voting Members. I believe 2015 will be one of the most successful in our history; and an advanced warm welcome to whomever is hired as HOT’s (non-interim) Executive Director:<a href="http://hotosm.org/job/executive_director_of_hot/2015"> http://hotosm.org/updates/2015-07-02_be_the_executive_director_of_humanitarian_openstreetmap_team</a></p><p dir="ltr"><img class="image-thumbnail" title="HOT" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/thumbnail/public/hotlogo.png?itok=ibmy_8UQ" alt="HOT" height="61" width="100">&nbsp;</p>
