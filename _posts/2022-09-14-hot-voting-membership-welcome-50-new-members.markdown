> We are happy to announce that 50 new members have been elected to HOT’s Voting Membership (VM)! HOT’s Voting Membership has grown to 266 members from all across the globe. These 50 new members come from 29 different countries and are helping us build a more diverse and equitable community. A few insights about how our membership is changing.

* Increased geographic spread: 
  * Previously 42% of our VM lived in priority countries and we are now at 51%. 
  * Only 3 people were voted in during this election who live in non-priority countries. 

* Represented Priority countries:
  * We now have 39 priority countries represented which is up from 30 countries last year. 
  * We also have 9 new countries with 1 VM
  * And 9 new and existing countries have at least 2 VMs (power in numbers)
 
* Gender:
  * Our Female:Male ratio was previously 28.6% female and is now at 31.6%

A big thanks to ALL members for helping recruit a cohort of new members who possess a broad experience within the OpenStreetMap community. The community is gaining new skills and  growing stronger each day through leadership, training, and mapping project participation. We look forward to working with HOTs Membership on issues related to the governance of the organization, electing the Board of Directors, and chair/co-chairing different working groups that touch all aspects of HOT’s work.
