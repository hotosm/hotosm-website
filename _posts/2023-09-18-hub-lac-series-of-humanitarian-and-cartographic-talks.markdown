Discussing and disseminating humanitarian issues from the perspective of collaborative digital cartography is a pending need in these times of climate change, environmental destruction, political and social crises, migrations and health emergencies.

That is why at the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Open Mapping Hub we decided to organize a cycle of monthly talks that address humanitarian and development issues from a cartographic perspective, that is, showing the contribution that citizen science and open and collaborative mapping can do to humanitarian work and sustainable development.

So, last Thursday, August 17, we inaugurated this cycle of conversations with the talk: "**The challenge of digital humanitarianism in Latin America and the Caribbean**". Our guests were: [Catalina Jaime](https://www.climatecentre.org/staff/catalina-jaime/), Head of climate and conflict at Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center and [Simone Lucatello](https://www.institutomora.edu.mx/Investigacion/SimoneLucatello/SitePages/Inicio.aspx), Director of the research program at the Dr. José María Luis Mora Research Institute. Our Director, [Fabrizio Scrollini Mendez](https://www.hotosm.org/people/fabrizio-scrollini/), led the session.
