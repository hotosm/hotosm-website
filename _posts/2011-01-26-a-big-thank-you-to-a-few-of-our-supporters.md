<p>As an organization, HOT is almost 100% bootstrapped. &nbsp;We are volunteer driven with most of our costs being project related and paid for by the organizations we partner with. &nbsp;However, in the past few months we've received some very generous donations from a few companies who are very active in OpenStreetMap and open-source GIS communities. &nbsp;These funds will go to helping us scale as an organization, starting an internship program, and developing custom software tools to improve our workflows. &nbsp;More news on both of these exciting projects soon. They will also help us pay for more boring, but utterly necessary things like an accountant, web hosting, and insurance when we send people to parts of the world undergoing crisis to provide support, training, and data. &nbsp;Without this, we would not be able to carry on our work, promoting the use of OpenStreetMap in humanitarian response.</p><p>Huge thanks and a round of applause to <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org">Development Seed</a> and <a href="http://geofabrik.de">GeoFabrik</a>. <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org"><img class="size-full wp-image-87 alignleft" style="padding: 10px;" src="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-26-at-10.34.41-AM.png" alt="" style="width:213px;height:44px"></a> <a href="http://geofabrik.de"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-86 alignleft" style="padding: 10px;" title="Screen shot 2011-01-26 at 10.34.04 AM" src="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-26-at-10.34.04-AM.png" alt="" style="width:213px;height:44px"></a> <img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://www.brutalundeath.com/photos/albums/userpics/10001/applause.gif" alt=""></p>
