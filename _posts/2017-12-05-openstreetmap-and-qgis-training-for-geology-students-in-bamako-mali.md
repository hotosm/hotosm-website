OSM Mali is grateful to receive devices to strengthen the community and enable more&nbsp;mapping projects.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">On the 13th to 20th November, nineteen geology students in Bamako participated in six days of&nbsp;OpenStreetMap (OSM) and QGIS training at the Faculty of Sciences and Technology. The&nbsp;training was conducted by OSM Mali members, thanks to devices received from&nbsp;HOT. Armed with the&nbsp;right devices, local people are empowered to collect data and map out their own communities to&nbsp;raise awareness of and contribute to development initiatives.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/sites/default/files/P_20171117_112327-300x169_0.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="/sites/default/files/P_20171113_142429-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169"></p><address class="MsoNormal"><em>Training in OSM &amp; QGIS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Collecting data&nbsp;</em></address><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Using the devices, OSM Mali have been able to provide&nbsp;students with the technology needed to collect data in Bamako. Before embarking in field&nbsp;mapping, students received training from OSM Mali. This training was the first time these&nbsp;students were exposed to OpenStreetMap and the amazing free software and tools available to&nbsp;them to produce open geodata, which they could then extract and reuse for any purpose. As&nbsp;future geology professionals, they were quick to understand the potential for empowerment –&nbsp;we cannot wait to see how they will take advantage of them in the field.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the first part of training, the students learnt how to use OSMTracker to collect data in the field&nbsp;and on the move. They then plunged into JOSM training to understand more powerful data&nbsp;production and quality assurance. The students were very happy to see their newly&nbsp;contributed data appear on the map, and then proceeded to extract the information&nbsp;with the Overpass API, bbbike and HotExport Tools.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The final part of training saw the students reusing OpenStreetMap data to create web maps with&nbsp;umap and QGIS. The six days of training have turned the students into true OSM supporters,&nbsp;ready to promote these tools!&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/sites/default/files/P_20171120_175050-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169"></p><address class="MsoNormal"><em>Newly trained mappers</em></address><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The students are grateful to have been offered the opportunity to participate in this rich training&nbsp;thanks to the Nethope device grant, and they thank the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team for its partnership with OSM Mali!</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/sites/default/files/P_20171114_122329_BF-300x225_0.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p><address class="MsoNormal"><em>Members of OSM Mali&nbsp;</em></address><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
