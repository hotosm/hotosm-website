created: 1283586879

<p>The coverage of the SPOT imagery has recently been shifted and much extended, to cover a great deal more of the flood affected area of Pakistan, as shown here:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?relation=1136222"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" title="Pakistan-SPOT-coverage" src="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Pakistan-SPOT-coverage.png" alt="Pakistan SPOT imagery coverage" width="399" border="0" height="602"></a> <br><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?relation=1136222">Updated SPOT coverage boundary relation</a> <br><small>Map data © <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a></small></p><p>Fantastic news! Thanks to SPOT we have lots of sketching to do. If you need help getting set up with <a title="WMS details on the wiki" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2010_07_Pakistan_Floods/Imagery_and_data_sources#SPOT">the SPOT WMS URL</a> in JOSM, you can still <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3_KJDD8bpE">use this tutorial video</a>, but when you come to zoom in and pick an area to download, you now have more places to chose from. All the areas shown in blue in the above map.</p>
