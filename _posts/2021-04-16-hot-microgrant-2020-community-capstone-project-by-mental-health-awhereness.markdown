Mental Health AWHEREness PH’s 2020 projects wouldn’t have been possible without Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)‘s Microgrant. Thank you, HOT!

Here’s our Community Capstone Project to thank all our partners and volunteers for a fruitful year of serving for the mental health advocacy. Remember, reach out and seek help. There is someone ready to help near you.

Through the help of the HOT Microgrant, we were able to share with mental health organizations and advocates more about our project, our mission and vision, and of course, about mental health.

We were able to teach more people on how to help map mental health services in the country through OpenStreetMap and our MHAPh Mapping Platform.
