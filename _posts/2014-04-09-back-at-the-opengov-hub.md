<p>I say "back" in quotes because since the last time I was at HOT's office in Washington D.C. 7 months ago it was in a completely different building. HOT is part of the OpenGov Hub which is a coworking place and center for open government related organizations in the Washington, DC area. We are part of the "mapping area" in conjunction with <a href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="http://groundtruth.in/">GroundTruth Initiative</a>. The new OpenGov Hub space just opened on April 1st of this year. This is one of HOT's two permanent spaces the other we share with <a href="http://wikimedia.or.id/">Wikimedia Indonesia</a> in Jakarta, Indonesia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Being part of the OpenGov Hub gives HOT both deskspace in DC, as well as have meetings and events. There are also networking benefits of being colocated with other likeminded organizations. The new move to a new place has allowed more organizations to join (currently even the new space is full) and to make the space more fit to use.&nbsp;I'll be in DC and present here until mid-May. If you are in town and want to meet or stop by <a href="http://twitter.com/wonderchook">let me know</a>! Look I've even provided a map below.&nbsp;</p>
