Project pages are individual pages about current or historical projects at HOTOSM. New pages can be added via Siteleaf or Github. Please follow these general steps to add pages -- which can include maps and data to show what and where work is happening. Jump to the the [training document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15sCWy-pgpTY0AvQcHQKamlXHZy9A7QXyfzk0vmcUHuY/edit?usp=sharing) for more detailed view with screenshots.

## Overview of steps: 

### 1. Create a new project via Siteleaf

### 2. Decide if you want to have a map-based project view or static hero image
  
  * Map-based will have an interactive map view at the top of the page instead of an image.
  
  * Static hero image will not have map but only a large full-width image that you choose. 


### 3. If map-based:
  
  * Create a geojson
  
  * Upload your project area geojson to the public website Google Drive
  
  * Add any other public map products you want to share to the Google Drive
  
  * Fill out required metadata details on Siteleaf
  
    * Tasking Manager data you want to show on the map
  
    * Map or other project documents
  
    * Links to specific datasets or data portals
  
    * Links to tools used within the project


### 4. If image-based:
  
  * Upload your image via Siteleaf
  
  * Fill out required metadata details
