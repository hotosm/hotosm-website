  Event Name: Mapping For Climate-Ready Cities
  Description: "<a style='color: white; font-weight: bold;'>Climate crises are inherently
    geographic. Yet many of the places where people are most vulnerable to climate
    change lack representation on maps, meaning communities and decision-makers do
    not have reliable data to address the converging crises they face.</a>"

  Header: Mapping areas vulnerable to disaster
  Text: Through the Missing Maps project, the HOT global community creates maps of
    high vulnerability areas where data is scarce, putting an area home to millions
    of people onto the world map in OpenStreetMap.

  Program Summary Text: "<a>**At Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we are addressing
    climate data gaps by working with local communities and partners to take anticipatory
    action. We ensure their realities are represented on the map and that communities
    are involved in climate-related decisions that will affect them.**</a>"

  we are mapping cities in four priority regions of the world and developing a thriving
  ecosystem to create, interpret, and use maps to respond to and reduce climate risks
  in densely populated urban areas.
Narrative-section:
  Narrative-title: Map Data for Anticipatory Action
  Narrative-intro-text: <a>Anticipatory action serves as a crucial link between long-term
    disaster risk reduction and immediate humanitarian response, particularly amidst
    the compounded threats of climate change and disasters.</a> <a href="https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb7145en">According
    to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)<a>, every dollar invested in anticipatory
    action could give families seven dollars in benefits and avoid losses. However,
    **anticipatory action efforts in vulnerable areas are hindered by a lack of data.**
  Narrative-text: "**HOT’s Mapping for Climate-Ready Cities program** will make open
    map data available in high-risk cities before a disaster strikes so that it can
    be used to plan for and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather and climate events.
    The proactive approach of this program will enable enhanced coordination and community
    involvement, facilitating early determination of response strategies and providers
    with ample time for training and capacity building. By leveraging map data to
    take preemptive measures, this program will mitigate potential crises, thereby
    saving resources and time and averting displacement, disease, and livelihood losses."
Quote: This Program provides open map data in high-risk areas before disaster strikes
  to bolster preparedness and mitigation efforts against extreme weather and climate
  events.
Project-objectives:
  Title: Proposed Program Goals & Objectives
  Objective1-highlight: Map 8-10 major cities
  Objectives-title-1: 'across 4 regions by 2025 with a focus on the most vulnerable
    populations in those locations. '
  Objective1: " Map"
  Objective2-highlight: Increase analytical capacity of stakeholders
  Objectives-title-2: to collect, analyze & use map data to advocate for climate-resilient
    policy and planning decisions.
  Objective2: " DATA USE"
  Objective3-highlight: Collaborate with local representatives
  Objectives-title-3: to embed open climate data into existing workflows to create
    data-informed policies & climate-action plans.
  Objective3: " INTEGRATION"
Approach-text: For 13 years, HOT has worked in collaboration with local communities
  to put the places they live on the world map. Our global community of 600K+ volunteers
  map buildings, roads, and key infrastructure on OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free open
  source map of the world. Our four Regional Hubs work in 94 countries, connecting
  with local organizations, government agencies, international networks, and others
  to ground truth map data and get locally created maps into the hands of decision-makers.
  Community knowledge, needs, and solutions are at the center, with HOT facilitating
  the end-to-end process of identifying missing data, mapping, analyzing data, and
  using that data effectively.

  Narrative: HOT’s Mapping for Climate-Ready Cities program will make open map data
    available in high-risk cities before a disaster strikes so that it can be used
    to plan for and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather and climate events. The
    proactive approach of this program will enable enhanced coordination and community

    saving resources and time and averting displacement, disease, and livelihood losses.
  Objectives-title-1: 'Map 8-10 major cities across 4 regions by 2025 with a focus
    on the most vulnerable populations in those locations. '
  Objective1: 'Complete an open map of critical infrastructure and environmental systems,
    including public centers, hospitals, homes, roads, waterways, coastlines, etc.
    Next, identify and map local climate risks in each city starting from tested risk
    and hazard modeling. These risks include, for example, the extent and severity
    of past flooding or neighborhood effects from changes to sea levels. Criteria
    for the cities selected include: climate vulnerability, local community capacity
    and interest, extent of existing map data, and access to recent aerial imagery.'
  Objectives-title-2: Enable local representatives to collect, analyze & use map data
    to advocate for climate-resilient policy and planning decisions.
  Objective2: "<ul><li>neighborhoods of each city. We will train local communities,
    government agencies, and organizations in collecting map data and open data use
    skills to catalyze citizen science. We will provide networking opportunities and
    grants to ensure peer-to-peer exchange.</li></ul>"
  Objectives-title-3: Embed open climate data into existing workflows to create data-informed
    policies & climate-action plans.
  Objective3: "<ul><li> Support local government, implementing partners and other
    stakeholders to build information systems that allow them take this community-centered
    approach forward independently: identifying challenges, collecting and analyzing
    data with local communities, and then using map information to collaboratively
    develop solutions. More, better and up-to-date data means that locals, advocates
    and decision-makers can make more rapid and better decisions.</li></ul>"
