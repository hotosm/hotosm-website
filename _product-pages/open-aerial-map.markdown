  Section: What is it?
  Header: OpenAerialMap is an open service that provides access to a growing collection of openly licensed imagery and map layer services. You can download or contribute imagery to this collection.
  Text: "Although imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster,it is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it. OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a simple open way to host and provide access to imagery for humanitarian response and disaster preparedness."
