Block 3:
  Header: "How does it work?"
  Highlight: Tasking Manager allows multiple individuals to work simultaneously on the same overall area, enabling rapid completion of the project.
  Text: "Through the TM, organizations create projects in which a specific geographic region is divided  into small mapping areas known as ‘tasks.’ These tasks can be assigned to a mapper to prevent others from mapping the same objects, introducing duplicate data, or encountering conflicts. Once the mapping is finished in a particular area, the mapper marks the ‘task’ as done. Mappers can then choose a new task to continue contributing to OSM in other projects and tasks.<br><br>Experienced mappers review each task to ensure the quality of the data added to OSM meets the required standards. They may either validate the task or return it to the mappers with guidance on how to enhance it."
