Block 1:
  Section: What is it?
  Header: 'The service uses AI models, specifically computer vision techniques, to
    detect objects such as buildings, roads, waterways, and trees from satellite and
    UAV imagery. The name fAIr is derived from the following terms:'
  Text: "**f**: for freedom and free and open-source software <br> **AI**: for Artificial
    Intelligence <br> **r**: for resilience and our responsibility for our communities
    and the role we play within humanitarian mapping"

  Text: 
  Rectangle-1:

    Header: 'fAIr: for whom?'
    Highlight: fAIr is a new AI mapping service tailored for humanitarian OpenStreetMap
      (OSM) mappers. It aims to boost mapping efficiency by offering AI assistance
      on mobile and web platforms. Users can create and employ their own AI models,
      enhancing mapping efforts in their regions or for humanitarian causes.
  Rectangle-2:
    Icon: fa-solid fa-group-arrows-rotate
    Header: What is fAIr exactly?
    Highlight: fAIr is a unique, open-source AI mapping tool. It empowers local communities
      to create and train AI models, fostering fairness and relevance in mapping.
      With constant community feedback, we combat biases and enhance living conditions
      in mapped areas.
  Rectangle-3:
    Icon: fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass
    Header: How does it work?
    Highlight: fAIr uses AI models by humanitarian OSM mappers to detect map features
      from open-source satellite and UAV imagery. It suggests additions to OSM without
      mass import, providing accurate feedback loops to enhance model intelligence
      through corrections by OSM mappers.
Block 3:
  Header: Why fAIr?
  Highlight: Tasking Manager allows multiple individuals to work simultaneously on
    the same overall area, enabling rapid completion of the project.
  Text: 'HOT sees that mappers can, on average, map between 1000-1500 buildings per
    working day without AI assistance. During an AI-assisted mapping pilot (2019-2020)
    supported by Microsoft, 18 million building footprints were extracted from satellite
    imagery for all of Tanzania and Uganda. HOT discovered during this pilot that
    this **average mapping nearly doubled** to 2500-3000 buildings being added to
    OSM per day with the assistance of high-quality AI open-source datasets. fAIr
    seek to solve three foreseen problems: <br> <br> **1. AI models openness:** AI-assisted
    mapping for humanitarian purposed feels like a black box. Useful open-source results
    coming from AI exists (e.g. [META''s global roads dataset](https://mapwith.ai/)
    available in RapiD). However, the models (code) are currently not open-sourced.<br><br>
    **2. Model bias:** Having model biases means predicting over satellite imagery
    would be biassed toward the training dataset used to teach the AI model and the
    nature and quality of imagery is very different across the globe. Here are three
    different images from Asia and Africa show totally different nature of imagery:<br><br>

    **3. Lack of feedback:** There is no enhancement applied easily on the intelligence
    and accuracy of the AI models and humans are out of the loop when building the
    AI models, this due to AI models being either closed source or were built once
    and made available to end users so enhancements would require repeating the process
    from scratch.. <br> <br> '

  Header: Open Aerial Map (OAM)
  Text: OpenAerialMap is an open service to provide access to a commons of openly
    licensed imagery and map layer services. Download or contribute imagery to the
    growing commons of openly licensed imagery.

Block 5:
  Header: Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM)
  Text: The FMTM is a standalone mobile and web application that works using OpenDataKit
    (ODK), a powerful data collection platform that leverages commonly-available mobile
    Android devices to enable people to input information including geospatial data
    in the field.
