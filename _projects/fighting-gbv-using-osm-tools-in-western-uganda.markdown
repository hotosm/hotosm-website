During the Covid-19 period, gender-based violence (GBV) cases rose by over 20% according to cases reported to the Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development. Most of these cases involved female adolescents. With the increasing numbers, identifying and follow-up by social workers was difficult.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/centerforlifechangedevelopement/">Center for Life Change Development (CLCD)</a> developed a project to fight gender-based violence (GBV) using OSM tools in Bushenyi District, Western Uganda. The aims of the project were to reduce GBV in Bushenyi district through sensitization and awareness in communities, to introduce OSM tools to social workers, police and other stakeholders, and generate maps of administrative boundaries, police stations and health centers.

Sensitization activities took place in three sub counties of Bushenyi district, namely Nyabubare, Kakanju and Bumbaire. This included three radio talk shows about GBV and activities were further extended to churches where CLCD worked with religious leaders. CLCD also worked with Bushenyi HIV & AIDS Network forum and Bushenyi district local leaders on GBV sensitization and awareness in communities and extended activities to Sheema district where there are high rates of HIV & AIDS.

<h2>KEY RESULTS</h2>

CLCD collaborated with <a href="https://mapuganda.org/">MapUganda</a> to conduct online and in-person training for volunteers from Bushenyi district communities on GBV issues. Fifteen volunteers were trained to use ODK for data collection, iD Editor and JOSM for remote mapping as well as Maps.me to add points of interest on OSM, and as a navigation tool to respond to GBV calls, and all sub counties in Bushenyi were mapped. Twenty-five maps were printed and given to police officials in Bushenyi.

Collaborations were formed with MapUganda in organizing mapathons and mobilizing volunteers to map remotely and CLCD was introduced to other OSM communities through events like the OSM Africa monthly mapathon that was key in completing the mapping and validation of the project.
