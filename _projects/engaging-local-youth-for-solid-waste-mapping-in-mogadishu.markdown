Across urban areas of Somalia a rough estimate of 3,700 metric tons of solid waste is generated each day. Mogadishu, the largest urban center and a safe haven for internally displaced persons as a result of cyclical floods, droughts, and a locust outbreak, has an arbitrary solid waste management program lacking a strategic framework to meet the demands of its growing urban population. 

While the government of Somalia regularly contracts private sector firms for solid waste management, and has witnessed some level of citizen mobilization and support, it still lacks the rigorous ability to regulate, monitor, improve, and hold accountable all actors engaged in a systematic solid waste management response.
