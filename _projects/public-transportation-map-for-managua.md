<p>There is no map for 42 bus lines in Metropolitan Managua, where about 80% of the 2 million inhabitants are dependent on buses to commute to work or school. Their sense of mobility is drastically reduced, because they do not know how to get to a new place away from their usual bus routes.</p><p>Over the last two years, over 150 volunteers from the&nbsp;<a href="http://mapanica.net" target="_blank">local OpenStreetMap community</a>&nbsp;surveyed the public transportation network of the capital city Managua and the nearby Ciudad Sandino and created a map, but in order to have a real impact for the population this map needs to be printed and distributed.</p><p>The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team assists the Nicaraguan OpenStreetMap community with their&nbsp;<a href="http://support.mapanica.net" target="_blank">crowd-funding initiative</a>, which allows the community to print 20,000 maps and give them to the people and have a real impact for the population.</p>
