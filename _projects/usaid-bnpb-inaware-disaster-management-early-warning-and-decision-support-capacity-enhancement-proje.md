Initiated in 2013, InAWARE provides hazard monitoring, disaster early warning, and decision support capabilities to disaster managers in Indonesia at both national and provincial levels. Early in 2016, a second phase of the program was approved, focusing on the enhancement of crowdsourced data derived by the PetaBencana&nbsp;tool and the collection of key disaster management planning and response data by HOT in Jakarta and Surabaya for incorporation into InAWARE. Enhanced interoperability between InAWARE and the DMInnovation <a href="http://inasafe.org/">InaSAFE</a> is also a key focus of this phase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;" href="Harry%20Madhardhika">Harry Mahardhika</a>&nbsp;is leading the operations and logistics of the mapping project, while being overseen by&nbsp;<a href="https://hotosm.org/users/iyan" target="_blank">Yantisa Akhadi</a>&nbsp;(Local Project Manager) and <a href="https://hotosm.org/users/mhairi_ohara">Mhairi O’Hara</a>&nbsp;(International Programme Manager). HOT is tasked with the development of a comprehensive geospatial base data for disaster risk including administrative boundaries, building footprints, road networks, and disaster vulnerability characteristics. The building footprints and road networks will initially be mapped remotely with the use of the HOT <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/" target="_blank">Tasking Manager</a> and up-to-date satellite imagery, which will then be supported by collecting associated attribute data out in the field with the use of the <a href="http://openmapkit.org/" target="_blank">OpenMapKit</a> application. Once the information is mapped by the Data Entry specialists, it will be reviewed and validated by a team of dedicated Data Quality specialists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The HOT team will also assist with training sessions for local BPBD staff, looking at the collection of OpenStreetMap data and its maintenance, as well as disaster management operational activities using InAWARE, PetaJakarta, and InaSAFE. Socialisation kick-off workshops with BNPB and BPBD will take place in Jakarta and Surabaya at the end of the month, so please stay in touch for updates on the program as it unfolds.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">The overall goal is to enhance capacity within national and provincial disaster management agencies to access automated international, regional, national, and local hazard information and supporting infrastructure data, as well as sharing information between agencies, and disseminating alert warnings to communities and populations at risk.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
