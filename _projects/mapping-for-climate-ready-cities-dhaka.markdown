Project Summary Text: |-
  Through our Mapping for Climate Ready Cities program, HOT is supporting the development of a thriving ecosystem focused on the creation, interpretation, and use of maps to respond to and reduce climate risks in urban areas across four priority regions.

  This project page highlights our work in Dhaka, Bangladesh through HOT's Asia Pacific Hub (AP Hub).

## Summary
Dhaka is one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world. With such rapid urbanization, Dhaka confronts challenges in population density that place immense strain on urban infrastructure, including public health centers, water and sanitation services, housing, and disaster response capabilities.

Vulnerable communities, mainly in slums or informal settlements, are also threatened by increasingly frequent and intense climate effects. 

The Open Mapping for Resilience project will address these challenges by establishing a comprehensive geospatial database in OpenStreetMap for humanitarian organizations, local authorities, and communities to adapt and transform the urban infrastructure in Dhaka for climate resilience.

## Background
Growing migration to Dhaka has led to a rapid expansion of slums and informal settlements, resulting in makeshift communities and poor urban planning. These areas have become highly susceptible to climate-related and man-made hazards like flooding, fires, disease outbreaks, and urban heat waves. This is further compounded by poor housing and limited access to healthcare, sanitation, and waste management.

These settlements miss out on the benefits of urbanization. With a soaring youth population, it is critical in the coming decades to develop a strong geospatial database to understand these changing population dynamics and needs. 

The open-source geospatial database will be a necessary foundation for better and more systematic urban planning. This includes equipping youth with digital skills in mapping and analyzing data for urban planning, healthcare, governance, and education. As the Bangladeshi government pushes for a digital nation with improved digital access and literacy, the HOT [Asia Pacific Hub](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/open-mapping-hub-asia-pacific/) (AP Hub) can be instrumental in supporting these efforts.

## Approach
In order to support urban development for sustainable and climate-resilient cities across the Asia-Pacific region, the AP Hub aims to build community knowledge and data flows by catalyzing open data ecosystems where local government, INGO, NGO, private sector, academia, and community actors come together to map both the most essential and critical features of developing cities in the Asia-Pacific. 

### Methodology
The project will address data gaps with partners, local communities, and stakeholders through remote mapping and validation. This will be followed by field data collection and mapping campaigns focusing on the most vulnerable slums and informal settlements. 

The data collection and awareness-building efforts will be supported by stakeholder training, workshops, and upskilling efforts focusing on data collection and data use for decision-making.

### Datasets Collected
* Base data (roads, buildings, water bodies, land use) 
* A more detailed data model to be developed with co-creation workshops with local stakeholders

## Expected Outcome and Impact
By catalyzing a vibrant, sustainable, multi-actor open data ecosystem in the cities, the AP Hub aims to create comprehensive and up-to-date geospatial data on OSM that will empower humanitarian organizations, local authorities, and grassroots communities to better understand, plan for, and respond to various challenges, including the effects of climate change, natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other urban development needs.
