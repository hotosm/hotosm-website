[Resilience Mappers](https://www.facebook.com/RMappers/) will be collecting data on the status of services in informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda. The data has been requested by the Kampala Capital City Authority GIS Department, and will be used to enable the equitable distribution of resources for upgrading informal settlements across Ugandaâ€™s capital. During the project, volunteers will be trained in remote mapping techniques including JOSM, ID-Editor, and Mapillary to contribute to OpenStreetMap.
