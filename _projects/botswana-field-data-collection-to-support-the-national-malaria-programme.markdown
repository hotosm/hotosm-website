Current OpenStreetMap data in Botswana include polygons (outlines) of all buildings identified via satellite imagery, but no additional information about the type of buildings mapped, or of household size are included, nor information on the general accuracy, validity, and completeness of remotely mapped data.

In order to improve the usefulness of OSM data in malaria elimination programmes, HOT is performing an on-the-ground data validation exercise across six districts. The data collected will be used to support logistics planning for Indoor Residual Spraying campaigns, provide more accurate data for further types of interventions, and allow better monitoring and evaluation of spaying campaigns.
