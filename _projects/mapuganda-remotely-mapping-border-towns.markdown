**Rapid Response Microgrant: COVID-19**

[MapUganda](https://mapuganda.org/) (OpenStreetMap Uganda) are collaborating with Geo YouthMappers and the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) to remotely map all 40 border entry towns across Uganda. The community will create detailed maps to support and retool the URCS and Ministry of Health surveillance efforts against the spread of COVID-19. By creating projects on the HOT Tasking Manager, conducting mapping webinars, and engaging local community and members of the MOH and URCS, MapUganda will create detailed datasets to identify porous borders where COVID-19 may be being imported into border communities.
