Project Summary Text: Satellite Imagery for Social Good is a single project with two
  distinct initiatives in Kenya and Nigeria.  Teams in Kenya and Nigeria are using
  Map with AI to add and validate AI-generated building footprints into OpenStreetMap
  to generate data that decision-makers need to plan and implement social-economic
  programs.

In Kenya, the team has conducted remote mapping and validation activities in Nakuru County. Nakuru was recently designated city status due to the ever-increasing population, approximately around 1 million. With this newfound status, the Nakuru city council is looking to update and improve the city-wide plan to accommodate the ever-expanding demands within the city. 
Through the Satellite for Social Good project, HOT has engaged the Nakuru County and city council and equipped officials from the physical planning and GIS departments with open mapping skills through the introduction to the OpenStreetMap tools, which include RapID and JOSM. Together with the OSM Kenya mapping community, the team has mapped and validated close to one million buildings within the county and added over 3,000 place names representing the lowest-level administrative centers in the region.

In Nigeria, the Satellite Imagery for Social Good project has remotely mapped over one million building footprints and roads across Bauchi and Gombe States in North-Eastern Nigeria. Ground-truthing activities have been completed, and plans are underway to support one key stakeholder in Bauchi state to address their data needs. The project aims to create data for use within microplanning for routine immunization within the region. Microplanning is one of the tools that health workers use in Nigeria to ensure that immunization services reach every community.
