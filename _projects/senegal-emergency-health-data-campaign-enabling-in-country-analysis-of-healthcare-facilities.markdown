**Rapid Response Microgrant: COVID-19**

OpenStreetMap Senegal and Healthsites.io will be mapping 197 hospitals in Senegal and updating data on the emergency health services available at these facilities. The community will compare the open data they collect for OSM with the datasets developed by the KEMRI-Wellcome Research Program in 2018 to enable an in-country analysis of the healthcare facilities available to support the COVID-19 outbreak. With no in-person visits to facilities, mappers will contact doctors at each facility to confirm the scope of services available. The data will then be used by the Senegalese Red Cross.
