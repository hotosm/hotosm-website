Unplanned refugee camps often consist of streets, tents, temporary shelters, shipping containers and temporary cutoffs. As a result, NGOs, volunteers and residents (especially those newly arrived) have difficulties finding their way to facilities, services and other resources. In addition, no information is available about the conditions of roads, shelters and safety risks. This needlessly complicates and delays aid programs and services, as well as finding proper locations for new facilities.

Mapfugees coordinated digitization of building/shelter footprints, roads, water points, toilets, showers and kitchens, as well as communal facilities, electricity points and public spaces in the refugee camps of Calais and Grande-Synthe/Dunkirk in Northern France in 2016. The project uses OpenStreetMap as a technology enabler to collect up-to-date geo-located data in a rapid, low-cost way.
