Many have a desire or opportunity to map their local communities, cities, and countries, but lack the basics to be able to do so, such as reliable equipment and funding to pay for transport and internet. HOT supports these projects through Microgrants and Device Grants. HOT's aim is to support and strengthen local OpenStreetMap communities through providing these basics in the form of small grants to key leaders who are transforming their countries through more maps.</span></p>
