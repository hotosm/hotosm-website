In Peru, GAL (Global Active Learning) School is empowering 11-16 year olds to develop their own projects for social good using OpenStreetMap, Open Data and 360 imagery. Students are currently developing mapping projects in three main areas of focus:
1) Disaster preparedness - landslides, informal housing & flooding in the Cusco region
2) Cultural heritage – improving awareness and exchange of traditional heritage as a form of preservation across Cusco and La Convencion 
3) Bus routes – improving the Cusco transport system through creating the first mapping of "combi”/ bus routes

The project has multiple objectives: Firstly, to encourage and empower youth to engage in improving the societies they live through responding to challenges they themselves identify; secondly to improve awareness of open source, digital technologies and platforms amongst children and all stakeholders in the area through peer learning; finally, to encourage sharing of experiences, specifically in the exchange of cultures through the global OSM network and other schools nationally and globally.
