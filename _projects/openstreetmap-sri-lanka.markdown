Sri Lanka's geographical environment and geomorphic and climatic conditions make it vulnerable to many natural disasters including floods, landslides, cyclones, droughts, gales, coastal erosion and tsunamis very frequently. Currently, local maps are not sufficient to create detailed emergency management plans, as well as mitigation plans to reduce the loss of properties and life when disasters occur. The OSM Sri Lanka team together with the OSGeo Sri Lanka Chapter are working hard to build detailed maps across the country to help emergency responders and planners in the future. They are rapidly growing the community through providing trainings to new university mapping groups across the country.
