[STOP Spillover](https://stopspillover.org/) is a USAID Funded consortium run through Tufts. 

As a partner of STOP Spillover, HOT works with consortium members and country teams to incorporate geospatial technology into the interventions to better understand public health risks and surveillance activities. HOT will work together with STOPS and local communities to fill in spatial data gaps in the regions of intervention, and map human animal interfaces to better monitor spillover disease.
