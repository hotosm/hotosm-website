With support from the Response Innovation Lab and Save the Children, HOT carried out a project across Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda to better understand the state of energy-saving solutions available to refugees in the settlement as well as relevant market trends and challenges associated with accessing and purchasing these solutions. 

In collaboration with refugees and host community members in Bidibidi, HOT led extensive data collection activities, gathering information from energy-saving solution retailers about where they purchased their products from, what their available stock consisted of, the biggest challenges they faced in selling these products to the refugee and host populations and much more.

Upon completion of the data collection exercise, the information was analyzed and compiled into maps and graphs to support a better understanding of the associated accessibility and availability of energy-saving solutions in the settlement. The information products and data were shared with the AMPERE consortium - a group of implementing partners working to enhance access and feasibility of energy-saving solutions amongst the refugee population across the settlement - to support more targeted efforts of enhancing clean energy product use, linking potential customers with the clean energy market and increasing awareness of such products across amongst refugees and respective host community members.
