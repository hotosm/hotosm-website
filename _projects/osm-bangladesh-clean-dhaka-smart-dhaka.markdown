Dhaka faces a tremendous challenge in terms of waste management. The 'Clean Dhaka, Smart Dhaka' project objective is to create a geo-database of waste disposal points in order to identify opportunities to make local urban waste management more sustainable and resilient through OpenStreetMap. This is currently a research project with the implementation, advocacy & activism phase upcoming. This project is initiated by the Bangladesh Open Innovation Lab (BOIL).
