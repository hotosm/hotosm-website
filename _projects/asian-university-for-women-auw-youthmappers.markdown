The Asian University for Women (AUW) YouthMappers team in Bangladesh is the first all women's YouthMappers chapter in the world. AUW have been gathering field data from deep tube-wells in Barayadala, Sitakunda where arsenic contamination affects water sources.

The data they have collected on arsenic-contaminated wells can be visualized on maps to help the government and NGOs to locate affected areas, improving the provision of safe drinking water for people living in affected communities.
