OSM Fiji (Fiji) will work closely with their local community to establish operational datasets for disaster risk reduction that are open, accessible, verifiable, and locally owned. They will also conduct community awareness workshops on open data, implement local mapathons, and form local, regional, and internal relationships to empower intersectoral participation in the use of OSM for disaster risk resilience in Fiji.
