After 22 years of imposed governmental internet restrictions, [YMCA Gambia](http://www.ymca.gm/) are leading the way in open data in The Gambia by training a growing community of young people to map social services such as hospitals, street names, water points, and key community assets.

The Gambia is very vulnerable to flooding, with heavy bi-annual rains and a flat topography. To abate this ongoing risk, YMCA Gambia are creating base maps to help inform future flood disaster relief plans and response.
