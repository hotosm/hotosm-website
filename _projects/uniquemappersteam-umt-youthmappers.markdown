Communities based in the Rivers State, Nigeria are vulnerable to oil spill disasters, flooding and malaria. UniqueMappersTeam (UMT) YouthMappers has three key focuses.

UMT's first area of focus is to make geographic data readily available to researchers, the private sector, government agencies, relief agencies and all stakeholders in Nigeria to respond rapidly to vulnerable communities and crises as and when they occur in the region. The team maps locally and remotely to gather data to put vulnerable communities on the map.

Secondly, the UMT are also working hard to improve female participation in mapping and the humanitarian/development sector through their branch of LetGirlsMap.

Thirdly, they are also working to grow the mapping community in Nigeria, establishing and training mapping teams in many Nigerian Universities for effective local disaster response. Their current mapping community includes Universities of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, the Niger Delta region and Nigeria. UMT is also currently mapping the University of Port Harcourt campus to showcase a globally accessible campus map.

Mr. Victor N. Sunday, the founder and Coordinator of UniqueMappersTeam(UMT) Port Harcourt, works actively with his team of Humanitarian Mappers as an affiliate chapter of YouthMappers Network (USA), Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and Citizen Science Association in Nigeria.
