OSM Zambia are collaborating in the 'Lusaka Sanitation Program', a project which is part of the Climate-friendly Sanitation in Peri-Urban areas of Lusaka (CFS-Lusaka) initiative. The data collected by OSM Zambia community members aims to provide local government and development services with detailed maps of the city. These maps will be used to improve on-site sanitation and waste management facilities to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera.
