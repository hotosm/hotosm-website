<p>In the middle of 2012, HOT ID train communities and government to collect exposure data, such as buildings, roads and population. These exposure data then stored, analyzed and processed with open source GIS tools. HOT has developed curriculum called SD4CP (Scenario Development for Contingency Planning) with the goal to deliver knowledges and skill of OSM, QGIS and InaSAFE for provincial and district disaster management agencies and other stakeholder in disaster management. This curriculum developed to be a reference curriculum, both for national level or provincial/district. The workshop course on SD4CP consist of three levels: Beginner (OSM and QGIS + InaSAFE), Intermediate (OSM and QGIS + InaSAFE) and Training of Trainer (ToT). The objective of this curriculum is to train people to be leaders and trainers in their respective region. After completing the training, participants will have the skills in OSM, QGIS and InaSAFE and training skills to help train others in developing a realistic disaster scenario for contingency plan.</p><p>Three years after the curriculum finished, HOT ID collected feedback from the training and use it to improve SD4CPâ€™s curriculum. From those input, HOT ID trying to develop a new curriculum in a more efficient way. From three level of the workshop (beginner, intermediate, TOT) it is then integrated into two phases: OSM Training and QGIS + InaSAFE Training for Disaster Management. Although only two phases, this new curriculum still have all the essential materials from SD4CP (iD Editor, JOSM, Validation, Tasking Manager, Field Papers, HOT Export, QGIS vector symbology, QGIS raster symbology, Map Composer, etc). The difference between SD4CP and this new curriculum are the amount of times needed for training and the aim. If the SD4CP takes almost 16 days to complete all the training, the new curriculum only need 6 days to complete all the training from OSM until QGIS.&nbsp;</p><p>The main objective of this new curriculum is to train people using OpenStreetMap and QGIS + InaSAFE for all phases of disaster management and develop understanding about using open data and open source software for disaster management. This new curriculum still in the development phase and can be accessed in <a href="http://inasafe.org/" target="_blank">InaSAFE</a> website in the documentation section: <a href="http://docs.inasafe.org/en/training/osm/index.html" target="_blank">Data Collection using OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="http://docs.inasafe.org/en/training/qgis/index.html" target="_blank">QGIS and InaSAFE for disaster management</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
