<p>HOT has teamed up with many partners working to eliminate the disease malaria.&nbsp; Malaria is preventable and curable and without transmission will cease to exist. In order to effectively carry out intervention campaigns, HOT has been asked to help identify and map populated places in some of the most susceptible places.</p><p>In partnership with DigitalGlobe, HOT mapped an area of interest covering over 560,000 square kilometers in Southern Africa (Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe), Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos) and Central America (Guatemala, Honduras) to support the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) <a href="http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org/program/malaria/">malaria program </a>and <span id="docs-internal-guid-cad9e9d3-e4d9-f1f7-70d9-ca3c915e7727">Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) <a href="http://visualizenomalaria.org/">Visualize No Malaria</a> campaign. From late 2016 until September 2017, 5305 mappers added 3,695,000+ buildings to OpenStreetMap.<br></span></p><p>From May 2017 until the end of September 2017, we entered another partnership with the USAID GeoCenter to enumerate buildings in Mali and Rwanda for malaria Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) efforts by Abt Associates under the <a href="https://www.pmi.gov/">President's Malaria Initiative</a> (PMI). Covering another roughly 30,000 square kilometers, 315 mappers contributed another 1,000,000 buildings to OpenStreetMap.</p><p>In August of 2017 our friends at CHAI were approached by the MENTOR Initiative and after demonstrating the building digitization we employ, we are now partnering with the <a href="http://thementorinitiative.org/what-we-do/malaria-2">MENTOR Initiative</a> to map buildings in Angola for IRS campaigns. Stay tuned here for news on all these amazing initiatives to eliminate the disease malaria.</p><p>We are mapping using our online <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org">Tasking Manager</a> tool, and/or the <a href="http://mapswipe.org/">Mapswipe</a> app.</p><p>The tasks for mapping will be continually updated <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/?sort_by=priority&amp;direction=asc&amp;search=malaria" target="_blank">here</a>.
