Project Summary Text: "\"The Nature Isle,\" Dominica, faces the ongoing threat of
  extreme storms, impacting lives and the environment. This prompted a collaborative
  effort to address the lack of comprehensive flood data for resilience planning.
  Through community-based mapping using mobile phones, the project updated building
  footprints in OpenStreetMap, providing crucial flood information. \n\nThe outcome
  includes 24 maps, 260 added building footprints, and a cultural shift towards open
  data use. Lessons learned emphasize mobile-friendly mapping and overcoming challenges
  for future climate resilience projects. Dominica emerges as a pioneer, showcasing
  adaptability in the face of climate hazards."

The Commonwealth of Dominica is also known as “the Nature Isle” due to its lush forest nestled in rugged terrain. Recent extreme storm events have severely impacted and threatened the inhabitants’ way of life as well as the environment. The scars and impacts of legacy storms, including Hurricane Maria (2017) also still present.

The increase in storms has resulted in a search for more sustainable methods of living and development over the long term. Research activity has often concentrated around high impact, high visibility events, therefore there is a lack of comprehensive observed flood hazards for household and community resilience planning. 


### Approach

To fill data gaps on flood risk to buildings, HOT and implementing partner Open Solutions for Business worked with mappers from Youth Emergency Action to update building footprints in OpenStreetMap and collected observed historical flood data per building. Following HOT training, communities surveyed reported per historic flood the damage level and other information per incident per building. Using a combination of Vespucci and Field Mapping Tasking Manager, all mapping was community based and accessible via mobile phones. Buildings and flood extents were compared to CEDEMA’s regional flood modeling risks. 


Impact

In total, 24 maps and survey collection forms were created for current and future use in flood resilience planning in Dominica. 260 building footprints were added to OSM, and many more flood data by building was provided to the Dominica government. 

A secondary outcome was the development of a mapping culture, on the ground, via remote mapping as well as through aerial mapping. The creation of this culture would foster greater open data use throughout the rest of the island, in preparation for future climate hazards, and act as a pilot for similar small island developing states in the Caribbean region.

Lessons Learned

To make the remote mapping more accessible and not reliant on desktop computers, all mapping was done via mobile phone on Vespucci and Field Mapping Tasking Manager. Both apps allow for remote mapping, however cloud free aerial imagery is a large challenge in the Caribbean, and future projects should consider availability of clear aerial imagery.
