<p>HOT through a partnership with AIFDR and BNPB, have trained and assisted government and communities on how to use OpenStreetMap to do exposure mapping and using QGIS and InaSAFE to analyze the impact of disaster.</p><p>InaSAFE is free and open source software that provides a simple but rigorous way to combine the data from scientists, local governments and communities to provide insights into the likely impacts of future disaster events. The software is focused on examining, in detail, the impacts that a single hazard would have on specific sectors. InaSAFE has been developed as a QGIS plugin to enable end users to not only complete a disaster impact analysis, but to also conduct further geographic analysis using the suite of QGIS tools that are available. The software includes a simple-to-use interface in the hope that disaster managers and other end users can easily create impact maps to inform contingency planning.&nbsp;</p><p>InaSAFE can process three types of input data: hazard, exposure and aggregation. All the data can be vector or raster data. Currently, InaSAFE can analyze 4 hazard types (flood, tsunami, earthquake and volcano) and 3 exposure data (population, building and road). Hazard data refers to singular disaster scenario, infrequent event and also frequently event. But, it’s important to note that InaSAFE is not a hazard modelling tool. Exposure data represent population count in certain area or important infrastructure (building and road). Aggregation data providing options to divide the analysis result by area, such as district boundaries. This feature can aid local governments to understanding the impact specific to their district. All the data that InaSAFE use are taken from various source, e.g. universities, science agencies, local government, communities and also OpenStreetMap (if the spatial data like building and road does not yet exist).</p><p>InaSAFE analysis run with combination of one hazard layer and one exposure layer. It could be a simple overlay of the two layers or complicated function that calculates if a building would fall down in an earthquake based on building structure information. The output of the InaSAFE analysis are two types, a layer that automatically loads into QGIS’s map canvas and list of estimate exposure data that affected by the hazard.&nbsp;</p><p>Preliminarily Launch: at Understanding Risk Forum in Cape Town on 3 July, 2012</p><p>Version 1.0 Launch: 5th Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in Yogyakarta, 23-25 October 2012</p><p>Version 2.0 Launch: Opening of the InaDRTG centre in Jakarta, 7 April 2014</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
