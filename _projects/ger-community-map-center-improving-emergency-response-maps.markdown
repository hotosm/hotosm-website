The Ger Community Map Center has trained the Emergency Management Department in Arkhangai province on OpenStreetMap data to provide people with updated information of settlement areas, natural resources and hazards such as forest fires, dzuds and floods. Previously, the Emergency Management Department responders did not have an open map platform to navigate the fastest accessible route to reach areas in need of help during natural disasters and the spread of animal diseases. The data on OpenStreetMap will support effective disaster relief in the future, and help identify appropriate new locations for outreach branches of the Emergency Management Department.
