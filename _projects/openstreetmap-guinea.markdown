OSM Guinea have been mapping health facilities in Conakry as part of their project 'Cartographie des structures privées de santé de la ville de Conakry'. The data collected highlights access to health services in the city which will be used to improve health standards and community awareness of the services available to them. This mapping will also help strengthen the governance of the health sector.
