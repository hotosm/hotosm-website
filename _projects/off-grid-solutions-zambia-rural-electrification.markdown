Zambia’s national electricity access rate is 31%, with only 4% of households in rural areas having access to electricity. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and OSM Zambia are mapping across eight provinces in rural Zambia to understand the viability of potential sites for renewable, off-grid electricity solutions, known as mini-grids. In collaboration with the Rural Electrification Authority (REA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Renier Lemoine Institut (RLI) and Integration, HOT and OSM Zambia are partaking in an “off-grid” electricity solutions project to collect data that will guide Zambia’s rural electrification strategies.
 
More than 785,000 buildings have been digitized across rural Zambia with the help of the HOT Tanzania mini-grid team. In addition, more than 50 mappers located across Zambia are working with HOT and OSM Zambia to complete detailed village-level, household, and private sector enterprise surveys. The data collected will be used to prioritize and characterize sites that lend themselves to off-grid energy solutions by providing a detailed understanding of the socio-economic context and energy demand of each potential site. The goal of the project is to inform decision-making and structuring of potential public-private partnership programmes for off-grid energy solutions in rural Zambia.
