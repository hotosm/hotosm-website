OSM Mali have been active for several years, and are currently concentrating on three main projects. These are:
* Mapping Bamako City: with the objective to improve the base map  to inform development initiatives. The project is over 65% completed. OSM Mali have also been facilitating training sessions in Bamako in collaboration with Agetic, a Public Administration Office that works in the digital sector and advocates ICT in Mali to support students and graduates to become involved in the technology sector. 
* Mapping Health Sites: this project aims to collect data points of health facilities across Bamako, and eventually extending to all of Mali, in order to build an up-to-date database of health services. 
* Mapping areas in Rural Mali: OSM Mali are expanding their mapping efforts into rural parts of the country to provide data on public services to encourage development in these areas.
