**2019 Microgrant**  

OSM Cameroon aims to create a free provision of GitHub – the code of the infrastructure they have built – so that the OSM Communities of surrounding African countries have an OSM data recovery infrastructure. Boot camps and work sessions will focus on introducing and training participants from different backgrounds to contribute towards and reuse OpenStreetMap data. They will also be equipped with tools to create their own open source geospatial products and platforms based on OpenStreetMap.   

**About the community**  

OpenStreetMap Cameroon aims to promote participatory cartography within Cameroon. Through awareness-building, training, and support for local populations and actors, OSM Cameroon aims to create an inclusive community where anyone can contribute to the local map. OpenStreetMap Cameroon promotes the collection, dissemination, use and reuse of cartographic data under free licenses, bringing together actors of Geographic Information in Cameroon: data owners, data producers, managers and users of georeferenced data. All of this is made possible thanks to OSM Cameroon’s infrastructure GeoCameroun, the first of its kind in Africa.
