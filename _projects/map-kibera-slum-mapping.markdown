The World Bank has partnered with Map Kibera to aid regional counties to engage citizens in an ongoing participatory budgeting process for development initiatives. The main purpose of this project is to use citizen-generated data to ensure that development projects within the counties meet the needs of the people. Map Kibera, using participatory mapping tools, has offered technical support in two Wards by training the county staff and youth within Makueni county on how to map using ODK and edit the data collected through JOSM. The maps will then be digitized to enable citizens engage their leaders further in the participatory budgeting process. 

In March 2018, two members of the HOT Tanzania team travelled to Kenya to conduct community mapping training and field mapping with the Kenyan NGO, the Karibu Centre, Salesforce volunteers, local residents, and Map Kibera members. Data was collected on key community features as well as residents employment statuses and education levels. The maps produced from the field data collected are helping to improve pre-school and after-school programmes, and job readiness training for underprivileged families.
