[OSM Zambia](http://osmzambia.org/) is working with the Lusaka City Council (LCC) in Lusaka, Zambia, to map solid waste management infrastructure and services. During the project, the community will map the boundaries of solid waste zones in seven peri-urban areas, the major road networks in the areas, the coordinates of areas where citizens dispose of solid waste, and the size of those areas. The team will facilitate four days of training for university students and LCC staff for using GIS tools.
