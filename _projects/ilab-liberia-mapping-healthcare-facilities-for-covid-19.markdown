**Rapid Response Microgrant: COVID-19**

iLab Liberia will use OSM to map active healthcare facilities across Liberia including testing and quarantine centers, COVID-19 hotspots and road networks, including collecting data on the services available at each facility. iLab will work with government, private sector, civil society and local community residents to use the data collected to better locate and identify services. iLab Liberia are partnering with the Ministry of Health, and other civil society organizations and networks to implement their project.
