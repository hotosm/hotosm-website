<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) is participating in round 11 of the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/">Outreachy </a>program. Originally known as the Outreach Program for Women (OPW), Outreachy is aimed at helping individuals from under represented groups get involved in free and open source software.&nbsp; It is open to women (cis and trans), trans men and genderqueer people, and all participants of the Ascend Project regardless of gender. This is part of HOT's larger goal to foster diversity in its community, as well as provide everyone the chance to have a starting point in open source.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><span class="s1">Round 11</span></strong></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Running from the 7th December to the 7th March 2016, HOT is participating in the 11th round of the Outreachy program.

They worked on a number of key open-source projects within the community, such as improving the help documentation of the HOT Export Tool, testing the usability of the HOT Tasking Manager and creating a QGIS plugin for the highly anticipated OpenAerialMap (OAM) project.
