Every year Mozambique suffers from extreme seasonal flooding. Learning from HOT's Ramani Huria project, the Mapeando Meu Bairro team are conducting flood extent surveys to better understand community risks and assets, and improve flood prevention planning. With this data, the community hopes to work with local decision makers to improve the resilience of vulnerable areas.
