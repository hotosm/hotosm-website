Projects targeting areas of impact identified by HOT were carried out in Niger to improve access to water in the Sahel region, The RUWA Niger project worked closely with the WASH Consortium, the Ministry of hydraulic, and the local authorities in the Dosso Region. Implemented by OSM Niger, local youth were recruited and trained the conduct Remote Mapping and ground-truthing activities. This project has contributed to add 22,086 buildings,  2210 amenities,  and trained 334, and 12 thematic maps have been produced and recommendations have been given for solutions to improve water access in the target region.

Access to quality healthcare for women and children remains a major challenge in the West Africa region, and Senegal is no exception. To promote access to women's healthcare, the Sunnu Wer Gyi Yaram project targets the Matam Region as a hard-to-reach part of the country that also experiences limited health services. Through national and local authorities, OSM Senegal and Marie Stopes as critical partners implemented the project through consultations, workshops, remote mapping, and field data collection.  The project promoted, enlightened, and provided reliable information on the situation of access, supply, maintenance, and overall infrastructure of the health facilities across the Matam Region in Senegal and 93,286 Buildings, 207 amenities have been added to OSM, 33 people have been trained and 10 thematics maps have been produced.

### Tracking Flooding - Climate Change

WNAH hub is tracking the flood in Liberia to promote anticipation as the countries of the Gulf of Guinea are exposed to devastating floods and rains, WNAH has addressed data gaps for the preparedness and response efforts of critical stakeholders working on climate effects and sustainable communities. Partnerships between key stakeholders, including government officials and development actors, have been established. By documenting the vulnerability, risks, exposure, and hazards through focus group discussions and data collection, we identified the gaps hindering the effectiveness of Disaster Agencies and the Red Cross in designing awareness and response efforts. The project encompassed 38 towns spread across 4 clans in the Commonwealth district, covering a total land area of 391.377 square kilometers, with 30,000 inhabitants. We successfully trained 75 people, added 18,880 building footprints and 251 kilometers of unpaved roads to the OpenStreetMap (OSM), benefiting five districts. The Commonwealth district has over 2,992 essential facilities, including amenities, healthcare centers, water points, public restrooms, educational institutions, financial and commercial establishments, fish production and storage facilities, waste disposal sites, markets, and burial sites.

### Sustainable Cities

This project was developed through a co-creation process with policymakers, emphasizing capacity building and providing them with the tools and approaches to utilize the project's data effectively. This capacity building enabled policymakers to analyze and interpret the data in various ways, including map creation, thereby enhancing their office operations and planning activities. OSM Togo, a strong partner, successfully executed the project involving remote mapping and ground-truthing data collection. As a result of these efforts, 3,490 amenities, 66,353 buildings and 127 people have been trained, and features have been added to OpenStreetMap (OSM), offering support not only to critical stakeholders but also to the inhabitants and visitors of these municipalities. Including these amenities on OSM is a valuable resource, contributing to improved service delivery and enhanced accessibility within the municipalities.

**Outcomes:**

* Over 35 stakeholders in Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and Yobe States benefited from the project directly.

* 20 Maps of Local Government Areas printed were distributed.
  More than 1.8 million building footprints.

* 35 flash drives containing open source software, pdf maps, training materials were distributed among participants attending a 3-day Stakeholders Impact Activity.

* 3 Local Communities (a collaboration of local OSM communities & tech hub conducted "ground-truthing" and remote activities).

* A web-based interactive map developed using data generated and existing data currently accessible across Nigeria.

### Small Island Project

The implementation approach of the Small Island program in Senegal was highly unique, considering that the target audience is illiterate. It began with a human-centered design thinking workshop conducted in the Wolof language, in partnership with REFEPAS, an association of women active in the fishing industry in the Saloum Islands. The Saloum Islands consist of 54 islands, and the workshop brought together over 15 women representing 15 different islands.

Over a period of 48 hours, the WNAH team and the women from the islands worked together to define the stakeholders, understand the challenges, and propose solutions to address the mentioned problems. Despite the illiteracy of the target audience, the workshop successfully utilized the Wolof language as a means of effective communication. This approach allowed for a deep understanding of the target audience, their issues, and the solutions that would be most suitable for them.

The outcome of this workshop had a positive impact on the implementation of the solution for these women. By focusing on the human element and addressing the specific needs of the target audience, the solution was well-aligned with their requirements and contributed to their well-being.

### Lucy - Pan-African Climate Change

**Open Data for Climate Action**
A new approach to involve the voice of the voiceless and push to action those who are not involved, but who suffer the consequences of climate change and the inaction of world leaders.

**Our Focus**

* Stimulate systemic change through localized actions by and for concerned, committed actors.

* Provide solutions that catalyze good, just,  and appropriate actions in synergy with communities.

* Make the populationâ€™s voices heard not as victims, but rather as actors of change.

* Data and maps are made by and for people about the issues that affect them.
