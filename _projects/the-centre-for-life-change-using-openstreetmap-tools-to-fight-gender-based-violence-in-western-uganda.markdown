The time of Covid-19 has seen a 20 percent increase in reports of gender-based violence in Uganda, according to the Ministry of Gender, Labour, and Social Development. The Center For Life Change and Development (CLCD), a female-led community-based organization fighting violence in western Uganda, will carry out OpenStreetMap training and mapping of critical social livelihood and care facilities in the Bushenyi district. The project aims to support the district social workers, police, and local government with handling gender-based violence cases through the use of maps to better navigate and locate GBV victims and seamlessly follow-up cases.
