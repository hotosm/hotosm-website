**[Facebook Community Impact Microgrant](https://www.hotosm.org/community/community-grants/)**

[MapBeks](https://mapbeks.com/) is an online community of volunteers advocating for LGBTQ inclusion and representation through various mapping platforms like OpenStreetMap. They are also engaged in mapping LGBTQ-safe spaces and experiences, HIV/AIDS facilities, and COVID facilities, as well as supporting emerging mapping communities.

The MapBeks Community, led by 14 core volunteers from the Philippines, will be completing basemaps for the 24 most unmapped towns in the Philippines, which are home to more than 500,000 people. They will be training and engaging with LGBTQ organizations, individuals and allies to map out buildings and roads in the selected areas.

Funding from HOT will enable the mapping of three selected municipalities, including San Andres and Ferrol in Romblon and Sultan Sa Barongis in Maguindanao. This will kick-off a year-long project and prepare volunteers to accomplish the 24-town target.
