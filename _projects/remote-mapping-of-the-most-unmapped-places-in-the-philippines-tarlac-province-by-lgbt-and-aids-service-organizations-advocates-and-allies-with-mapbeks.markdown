[MapBeks](https://www.facebook.com/mapbeks) (Philippines) is an online community of LGBTQIA+ mappers and volunteers who will map the most unmapped province in the country. With the partnership and support of the Provincial Local Government Unit of Tarlac and several LGBT and AIDS service organizations, they plan to remotely map an area home to 1.3 million individuals at high risk of heavy flooding. Furthermore, they will be conducting SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Expression, and Sex Characteristics) trainings in conjunction with OSM and JOSM courses and validation webinars for LGU partners and local university students.
