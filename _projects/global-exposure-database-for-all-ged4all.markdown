HOT has partnered with the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) and ImageCat on a Challenge Fund focused on developing a global exposure database for multi-hazard risk analysis. The Challenge Fund, formed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) is aimed at building local and global resilience through innovation in order to better identify risk and enable more effective decision-making.

This is the second round of the Challenge Fund, which focuses on three pilot projects that address the recommendations made in the recent GFDRR report ‘Solving the Puzzle: Innovating to Reduce Risk’ - namely, to expand the effort to decrease disaster risk management costs and increase resilience by developing a framework that facilitates a multi-hazard view of risk. Based on this research, efforts are being focused on developing the first set of open and internally consistent data on hazards, exposure, and vulnerability.

Challenge 1, is led by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and focuses on developing a data schema and data for a multi-hazard database. Challenge 2, is led by GEM and focuses on developing a data schema and data for a global exposure database, whom HOT is partner with. Challenger 3, is led by University College of London (UCL) and focuses on developing a data schema and data for a global database of vulnerability functions.

The development of the open global exposure database aims to store different assets including, infrastructure, land-use, and socio-economic data. These assets will be relevant for multiple natural hazards, including earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, strong winds, tsunamis and drought. Individual infrastructure features will be populated with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, as this is considered to have the best global coverage at the building level. HOT will support GEM with Challenge 2 by proposing a methodology for creating a bottom-up exposure model with the use of OSM, taking into account its data model and the use of associated tools.

Although the three Challenge Funds are being developed somewhat independently, it is crucial to ensure their compatibility. For example, the spatial resolution between the exposure and the hazard must be compatible, as well as the taxonomy employed for the classification of the exposed elements and respective vulnerability functions. In parallel, two other databases are being created to store hazard footprints and vulnerability models. All three databases will be tested with data for the country of Tanzania.
