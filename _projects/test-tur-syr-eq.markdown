Project Summary Text: After any disaster, data is critical for life-saving and sustaining
  activities and recovery programs. Since 2010 and the<a href="https://www.hotosm.org/projects/haiti_">
  devastating earthquake in Haiti </a>, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT),
  as part of the wider OpenStreetMap (OSM) community, has been working to provide
  spatial data to inform disaster response and recovery via OSM.

During the Syria-Turkey earthquake in February 2023, OSM is again proving to be a valuable resource in search and rescue efforts, contextualizing and accessing damage assessments, and planning relief and recovery efforts. Much of this data is the result of a <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/disaster-services/turkiye-earthquakes-february-2023-activation/"> huge solidarity effort from thousands of OpenStreetMap contributors </a>in both the affected countries and around the world. In a humanitarian response such as this, it is hard for a member of the public to contribute beyond making a financial donation, but data generated by mappers is already in the hands of responders and having an impact on the ground. 

<h3>Road Networks</h3>
Earthquakes create extreme challenges for navigation. Internet and cellular networks are damaged or overloaded, and damage to roads and bridges means navigation data from before the quake are suddenly inaccurate. For Ankara surgeon Dr. Çevik working to save lives in communities damaged by the earthquake in the Hattay region, Organic Maps and the OSM data that feeds it were essential for him and his colleagues to get to the people that needed medical attention.

<h3>Critical infrastructure</h3>
Beyond road networks, information on OSM about critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, pharmacies, food depots, transportation nodes, and settlements, is playing an important role in providing organizations like the World Food Programme key insights into field conditions, both pre- and post-earthquake, for logistics planning. Without this data, planning the movement of goods, resources, and personnel efficiently in the aftermath of an earthquake of this magnitude would be much more challenging.

<h3>Base maps</h3>

OSM enables the rapid creation of maps in areas that did not have pre-existing map data. In the aftermath of this earthquake, the capacity for real-time updates and open access meant that aid agencies Search and Rescue Association(<a href="https://www.akut.org.tr/"> AKUT </a>)and Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Interior Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (<a href="https://www.afad.gov.tr/"> AFAD </a>) were able to use OSM data in their maps to coordinate and ensure that logistics resources were used efficiently. In a scenario such as this, knowledge of the built environment enables better decisions  for reaching people in need and understanding  people’s requirements and what infrastructure exists locally.

<h3>Imagery and Building damage </h3>

Promptly after the earthquake hit, organizations like the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (IFRC) requested building-level vector data for post-disaster damage assessments from Yer Cizenler, the coordinator of the response. Using government data, a Copernicus damage analysis (link), and pre-disaster OSM building footprints ( more than 1.6 million have mapped through today via the HOT Tasking Manager), IFRC performed a geospatial analysis to help them plan their aid in relief and recovery efforts by pinpointing the exact location of each destroyed building.

<br>

With the intent of increasing the availability of damaged building data and properly reflecting the current state of the conditions in the ground in OSM, Yer Cizenler also used the Copernicus damage analysis to update  OSM buildings through a MapRoulette campaign (link). The validation process involved high resolution imagery from drones and satellites, which helped ensure the quality of the digitizwd data. The resulting dataset that identifiesls destroyed buildings is now <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tur_destroyed_buildings"> available through HDX </a>and has been downloaded over 500+ times. 

<h3>The data needs will evolve</h3>
In addition to the above, and as the phases of the response shift, OSM data will also be used for long-term recovery efforts, such as rebuilding infrastructure and housing and improving disaster preparedness. The availability of detailed, up-to-date map data is an important resource in all stages of the disaster recovery process.

It is important to remember that behind each data point, there is a tremendous human effort from volunteers and organizations. Every single object that has been mapped so far, has had human eyes creating, modifying, or validating it. The effort continues and, if you are a mapper who wants to get involved,<a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tur_destroyed_buildings"> you can do so here</a>.
