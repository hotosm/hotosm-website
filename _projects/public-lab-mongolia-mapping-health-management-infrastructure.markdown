**Rapid Response Microgrant: COVID-19**

High population density in Ulaanbaatar, access to public health services, and the distance between remote rural communities and healthcare facilities are challenges that will leave communities in Mongolia vulnerable during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In partnership with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), [Public Lab Mongolia](https://www.publiclabmongolia.org/) plan to map health service infrastructure and essential services in all 21 provinces of Mongolia to promote disaster preparedness amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The microgrant will enable Public Lab Mongolia to develop a complete OSM dataset on health service infrastructure including health services, pharmacies, banks, grocery stores, and petrol stations.
