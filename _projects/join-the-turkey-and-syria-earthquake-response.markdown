Thank you to everyone in the open mapping community who supported the response to the Turkey and Syria earthquakes. You have made a vital contribution.

### If you are an experienced validator...

Due to the amount of mapping that was conducted in support of this response, there is still plenty of validation to be done for the [projects in this campaign](https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore?campaign=Turkey%20and%20Syria%20Earthquake%20Response%20February%202023).

If you are an advanced mapper and would like to join the HOT Global Validators Team, [please fill in your details here](http://bit.ly/HOTValidators).

### Where to find data:

* Download [datasets of the affected areas from HDX](https://data.humdata.org/event/turkiye-syria-earthquakes). Datasets are regularly updated with new data from the OSM mapping above.

* Visit the [Turkey and Syria Earthquake Response Activation page](https://www.hotosm.org/disaster-services/turkiye-earthquakes-february-2023-activation/) for more details and statistics on the mapping response.
