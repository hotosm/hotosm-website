### How to participate as a beginner mapper:

Much of the beginner-accessible mapping has already been completed, but your interest in mapping is appreciated! There are always lots of projects that are accessible to beginner mappers on the [Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/), and even projects that are not urgent are still important.

You can also contribute to the [MapRoulette challenges of Yer Çizenler](https://maproulette.org/browse/projects/51027) to tag the collapsed buildings from verified datasets. (Challenges not always available. Check back regularly.)

We also recommend you find support and advice on the [HOTOSM slack channels](https://slack.hotosm.org/) for #disastermapping and #mappersupport

### If you are already an intermediate or advanced mapper...

The priorities for mapping on the HOT tasking manager are currently:

* [MISSING MAPS - EARTHQUAKE SYRIA, LATAKIA DISTRICT](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14230)

* [M7.8 EARTHQUAKE TÜRKIYE, OSMANIYE DÖRTYOL İSKENDERUN KIRIKHAN](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14233)

* [M7.8 EARTHQUAKE TÜRKIYE, KAHRAMANMARAŞ](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14262)

You can find the complete list of projects [here](https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore?campaign=Turkey%20and%20Syria%20Earthquake%20Response%20February%202023).

### If you are already an experienced validator...

The priorities for validation on the HOT tasking manager are currently:

* [MISSING MAPS - EARTHQUAKE SYRIA, LATAKIA DISTRICT](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14230)

* [M7.8 EARTHQUAKE TÜRKIYE - GAZIANTEP RESPONSE](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14226)

If you are an advanced mapper and would like to join the HOT Global Validators Team, [please fill in your details here](http://bit.ly/HOTValidators).

### Where to find data:

* Download [datasets of the affected areas from HDX](https://data.humdata.org/event/turkiye-syria-earthquakes). Datasets are regularly updated with new data from the OSM mapping above.

* Visit the [Turkey and Syria Earthquake Response Activation page](https://www.hotosm.org/disaster-services/turkiye-earthquakes-february-2023-activation/) for more details and statistics on the mapping response.

## How is the data being used?

Emergency responders have shared how they have found OSM data invaluable.

And we have shared numerous other use cases via our blog and OSM diaries:
* [Turkey And Syria Response: A Month After The Earthquake](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/turkey-and-syria-response-a-month-after-the-earthquake/)
* [Using OSM Data in the Turkey and Syria Earthquake Response](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/using-osm-data-for-the-turkey-and-syria-earthquake-response/)
