**Rapid Response Microgrant: COVID-19**

Humanitarian Mappers will be mapping safe places and quarantine centers in IDP camps as well as isolation centers in Northeastern Nigeria (Borno, Adamawa, Yobe). The project will digitize roads, tag/name features, and provide road attributes by training local community members and ambulance response teams in using OSM and OSM routing tools. The project will work with student volunteers from institutions of higher education in the region, who will conduct remote mapping, and the state COVID-19 Taskforce Team, who are the identified local data users.
