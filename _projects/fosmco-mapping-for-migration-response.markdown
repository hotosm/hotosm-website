**2019 Microgrant**  
Fundacion OpenStreetMap Colombia (FOSMCo) is a 2018 HOT Micrograntee that was awarded a follow-on grant for 2019. FOSMCo will be working at the frontier of the migration response in Colombia. They will continue to support mapping the frontier with Panamá, working with citizens and authorities to provide map data that can improve security. The group will also support the migratory emergency on the Colombian-Venezuelan border by creating clear maps of border areas. 

**About the community**  

Fundación OpenStreetMap Colombia (FOSMCo) was created in 2016 to consolidate the work of the OSM community in Colombia and improve cooperation. Since then, FOSMCo has sought to improve their technology and infrastructure autonomy, embed themselves within the Humanitarian Mapping Unit, and improve outreach by working with mayors, governors countryside communities, NGOs, land management institutions, universities and risk management institutions. 

FOSMCo has worked in the crisis rooms of the main emergencies in Colombia in recent years, with the vision of supporting the Latin American and Spanish speaking OSM community to strengthen the use of technology and OSM in response plans and outreach.

Today, FOSMCo is made up of 20 team members directly involved in operations, and more than 150 volunteer mappers in the country.
