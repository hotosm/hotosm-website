**2020 Microgrant**

To reduce the stigma and increase access to mental health services, Mental Health AWHEREness aims to use map data that highlights the locations and supports of mental health services and work with policy-makers to increase access for all.

Mental Health aWHEREness created an online platform and crowdsourced map that shows the locations and information on mental health services to make it easier for people to look for professional help. With a map, more people dealing with mental health issues can find the information they need safely, securely, and without judgement. Mental Health aWHEREness not only mobilizes volunteers to map where and what services are available and trains people how to map, but it also provides a non-judgemental space for people to talk about mental health.
