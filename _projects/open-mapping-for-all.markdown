## OBJECTIVE
We are catalysts for technological innovation in education, engaging teachers, and enabling students in low-resource settings. Our mission is to create and leverage open map data for active learning, community engagement, and to nurture the next generation of mappers.

## WHY IT MATTERS
* **Transformative Education:** Your contribution directly impacts the education of 15-18-year-old students in schools facing ICT limitations, with a special focus on marginalized populations such as indigenous and girls.
* **Localized Impact:** We adapt training to meet local needs, linking it to core competencies in social studies, citizenship and science, as well as more disciplines, ensuring relevance to the communities we serve.
* **Practical Application:** Teachers and students participate in field and remote mapping projects focusing on STEM, climate, gender and equality, humanitarian, social issues and actively solving real-world problems.


## IMPLEMENTATION
1. Introduce open mapping tools
2. Train teachers and students in schools with limited ICT capacity
3. Providing technical support and building relationships with teachers during the mapping project
4. Adapt training to local needs and context
5. Link to core competencies in education curriculum
