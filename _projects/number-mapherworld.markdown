From 13 March 2023 to 20 June 2023, the Open Mapping Hub - Eastern and Southern Africa is running a mapping campaign aimed at increasing the visibility of women-focused points of interest (POIs) on OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Our goal is to identify and map places such as women's health clinics, childcare facilities, and safe spaces for women, to make them more visible and accessible. But our ambition goes beyond mapping alone. We also hope to foster greater participation from women and create a community of mappers and advocates who are committed to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment through open mapping.

This is an incredible opportunity to put your data skills to the test and showcase your talent to the world. To participate, just follow these easy steps:

Step 1
Complete the sign-up form to join us as either an individual or a team member  (preferably in teams of (3) three).

Step 2
Download the Every Door mobile app and start mapping the following features:

This campaign mobilises the open mapping community to put amenities used by women and girls in communities across East and Southern Africa on the map (although everyone is welcome regardless of their location!)

This can include health facilities, schools, childcare, police stations and much more. A [full data model is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIaYkWQlxq-E6ofRrvYdXageqWJCkSMGSi2CicLU5wM/edit?usp=sharing)!

We hope that by putting these vital amenities on the map that we can improve access to services, visualise what is available and help people advocate for increased and improved services.
