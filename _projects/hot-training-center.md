<p><span class="autogrow-textarea">HOT has developed a curriculum for its volunteer 'Activators'; specifically a protocol and training program to empower those people who coordinate our <a href="http://hotosm.org/projects/disaster-mapping">Disaster Mapping</a>. Key roles were identified during initial development and observation of the Nepal Activation. <br><br>The <span class="file"><img class="file-icon" title="application/pdf" src="/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png" alt=""> <a href="/sites/default/files/HOTActivationProtocol_0.pdf">HOTActivationProtocol.pdf</a></span> and the bulk of the raw training material was drafted through an ‘Activation Sprint’ workshop of core HOT coordinators in Washington DC, 27-29 April 2015. The curriculum was then further developed by specialist, <a href="http://hotosm.org/users/russell_deffner">Russell Deffner</a>, under the supervision of Technical Project Manager, <a href="http://hotosm.org/users/mhairi_ohara">Mhairi O'Hara</a>; with community input and direct involvement of existing HOT Activators and the Activation Working Group.<br></span></p>
