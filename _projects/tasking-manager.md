<p>The OpenStreetMap (OSM) Tasking Manager is a mapping coordination tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team collaborative mapping efforts. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping project into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need mapping validated.<br>This approach facilitates the distribution of mapping tasks to many mappers simultaneously during a crisis to quickly provide base map data to responding organizations. It also permits prioritization of areas and promotes quality and uniformity of the work done (e.g., elements to cover, specific tags to use, etc.).</p><p>Read more about<a href="https://www.hotosm.org/projects/osm_tasking_manager_30_development"> Version 3 Development</a></p>
