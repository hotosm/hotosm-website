The Bangladesh Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Operation Team (BHOOT) and Pathao Ltd, one of the major ride sharing service providers in Bangladesh besides Uber, are collaborating in the Map Your City initiative which aims to map all major cities in Bangladesh. So far, the initiative has mapped extensively in Dhaka and since expanded to Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Comilla, Mymensingh and Jessore. These maps will contribute to sustainable urban development initiatives.
