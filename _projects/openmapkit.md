<p>An 'Open Data/Map' app was originally conceived from OSM <a href="http://americanredcross.github.io/OSM-Assessment">damage assessment research</a> during the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan response on behalf of the American Red Cross (ARC) and the United States Agency for International Development. In early 2014, during a competitive proposal process ARC beat out a lot of other bids and was chosen to build an ODK/OSM survey tool for work tied to an ARC project in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p><p>In June of 2014, HOT was <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201449229/">awarded a Knight Prototype Fund</a>. The funds would be use "To allow easier collection of open geographic data, even in places with connectivity issues, by combining Open Data Kit’s data collection with OpenStreetMap’s data community."</p><p>As HOT and ARC have had a long running partnership; after discussion the decision was made to roll the two projects into one complete project. The result is <a href="http://github.com/americanredcross/openmapkit">OpenMapKit</a>!</p>
