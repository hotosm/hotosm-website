# About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 160,000 people with ground operations in eight countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

# About the Role
HOT’s Director of Technology serves as the organization’s Chief Technology Officer as part of HOT’s senior management team, reporting to the Executive Director. Leading via collaboration, the Director of Technology guides HOT’s thinking around innovative open-source software tools and workflows, supporting our vision of enabling every person to contribute to a collective map of our world. The Director of Technology will advance our core beliefs around technology:
* Design with the user: Producing tech that meets local needs & community-identified problems
* A space for technology innovation: Leading the way in conceptualizing and developing humanitarian map data apps, tools, & defining workflows used across the sector
* The home for open source: A neutral convener and steward of open source mapping software for humanitarian action and sustainable development
* Principles for Digital Development: HOT’s work, where possible, aligns with the Digital Principles

The Director of Technology oversees a team of 11 staff members, including four project/product managers and seven developers, support engineers, and designers working remotely across multiple time zones. This team is responsible for the development, maintenance, and support of [10 open source apps and tools](https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data) that enable collaborative editing, analysis, and visualization around OpenStreetMap. These tools are relied upon by dozens of humanitarian and development sector partners including UN agencies, the World Bank, Red Cross societies, Médecins Sans Frontières and other NGOs.

In line with HOT’s [Strategic Plan](https://www.hotosm.org/strategic-plan.html), the Director of Technology will have a significant role in advancing technology strategy for the organization, community of volunteers, and partner organizations relying on HOT tools. This includes dramatically scaling the quantity and quality of data produced by the HOT network through the introduction of machine learning and shifting toward mobile-first workflows as we aim to map an area home to 1 billion people over the next three years. To succeed in this role, the Director will work closely with HOT field programs and community teams, remotely and with occasional travel to HOT program locations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
