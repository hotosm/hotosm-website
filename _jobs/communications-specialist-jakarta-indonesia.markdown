**Location:** Jakarta, Indonesia

**Report to:** Indonesian Country Manager & HOT Senior Communications Specialist



**Background**

HOT is collaborating on a USAID, Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) funded program together with the University of Hawaii: Pacific Disaster Centre (PDC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): PetaBencana to support the Government of Indonesia: Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB). The program is focused on the development of InAWARE, a disaster management tool, aimed at improving overall risk assessment, early-warning, and disaster-management decision making in Indonesia.

A well-established relationship between PDC and the Indonesian national disaster management agency, BNPB, led to the development of a customized version of the DisasterAWARE system for Indonesia. Initiated in 2013, InAWARE provides hazard monitoring, disaster early warning, and decision support capabilities to disaster managers in Indonesia at both the national and provincial levels. Early in 2016, a second phase of the program was approved, focusing on the enhancement of crowdsourced data derived by the PetaBencana tool and the collection of key disaster management planning and response data by HOT in Surabaya, Jakarta, and Semarang for incorporation into InAWARE.

To assist in outreach and communications, HOT seeks to hire a Communication Specialist for this program.

* Creating print and marketing materials
* Coordinating HOT related communications and outreach outside of Indonesia.
* Working with the HOT team to create marketing and How-to videos. 

**Practicalities**

This position is based in Jakarta, Indonesia, with the primary place of work being at HOT Indonesiaâ€™s workspace. Depending on the grant requirements, there might be some travel within and outside Indonesia. The position is currently funded until the end of December 2019, with possible extension.
