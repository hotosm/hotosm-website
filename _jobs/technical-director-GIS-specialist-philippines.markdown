## About HOT

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 175,000 people with ground operations in eight countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

HOT is soliciting CVs of experienced OpenStreetMap professionals to help lead a project in the Philippines, starting as soon as possible (September 2019). This assignment is expected to last 12 months with the possibility of extension.
 
## Profile

HOT’s project in the Philippines focuses on supporting the expansion of DisasterAware (https://www.pdc.org/apps/disasteraware/), and supplying accurate and up to date open data (via OpenStreetMap) to feed into this platform.
