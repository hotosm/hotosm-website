The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team is soliciting proposals for a design firm to research and design a new Tasking Manager mapping workflow. The project will focus on reducing errors per square kilometer, improving speed of buildings mapped per minute, and increasing rate of return of mappers.

The design solicitation is part of the larger on-going machine learning work from HOT and its partners and is part of an upcoming project to generate new machine learning datasets.

### Project Brief

Key scope and timeline points below. [Read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SE1-M5FWuI4Rl4RHIQSRyoVB6j43f3T2eNsUFS_I6yo/edit?usp=sharing) for full project brief with background information. 

**Overall Project Goal:** Update the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Tasking Manager and processes to incorporate outputs from Machine Learning Models and through the Task Manager application allow volunteers to validate and deconflict model outputs before publishing to the OpenStreetMap (OSM). Also provide a retraining loop from OSM back to inputted models.

**Overall Design Scope:** To research and design a new Tasking Manager mapping workflow that focuses on improving speed of buildings mapped per minute, reducing errors per square kilometer, and increasing rate of return of mappers. 

#### Initial Needs and Design Scope
As we begin developing the backend updates to the Tasking Manager, we want to evaluate and propose updates to the user experience of the Tasking Manager to solve the identified issues around speed, quality, and retention.

Objective: To research and design a new Tasking Manager mapping workflow that focuses on reducing errors per square kilometer, improving speed of buildings mapped per minute, and increasing rate of return of mappers.

**Activities we see as critical:**
* Conduct stakeholder and user interviews
* Usability tests to identify bottlenecks and problem areas with current workflow
* Facilitate and in-person design workshop with stakeholders and users
* Create storyboards and wireframes to prototype concepts

**Potential timeframes and deliverables:** 
* January -- Project starts, conduct user and stakeholder interviews, usability testing
* End of January / Early February -- design workshop (location TBD, potentially Jakarta)
* February -- Complete storyboards for four core user workflows: 
  - Mapathon/new mapper workflow
  - Experienced mapper workflow
  - Validation workflow
  - Project Manager workflow
* March -- Complete wireframes for four core user workflows:
  - Mapathon/new mapper workflow
  - Experienced mapper workflow
  - Validation workflow
  - Project Manager workflow
