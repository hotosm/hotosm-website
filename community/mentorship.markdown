## Join the Open Mapping Mentorship!

<!-- ![Mentorship_onboarding1_27May2023 (1).png](/uploads/Mentorship_onboarding1_27May2023%20(1).png) -->
The HOT Community Working Group initiated a Mentorship Program to provide peer to peer learning and knowledge exchange in the humanitarian and open mapping space. 


The Program is also inspired by Angela Teyvi during her Community Working Group Ask Me Anything (AMA) Session in March 2022. Angela shared how mentorship has played a major role in her career development and capability in humanitarian open mapping. [You can watch the recording here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4EckEvVA0I)

We built upon the knowledge and efforts of other mapping communities in conducting their mentorship program, most specifically [Women+ in Geospatial (W+G) Mentorship Programme.](https://womeningeospatial.org/mentorship-programme/)

**The pilot program was initiated in 2022 and continued in 2023.

## 2022 Pilot Mentorship

In the pilot phase, the mentorship structure is peer mentorship. In peer mentorship, all members receive mentorship and are organized by a group facilitator who is already part of the group. The choice of this type of mentorship is to boost the interest, knowledge, and confidence of mentors to become great mentors for the next cohort of mentees.

## 2023 Mentorship Program: Building on the pilot mentorship program, we are proceeding

with a Mentor-mentee and group mentorship structure. Lessons, feedback, suggestions from the pilot will be heavily incorporated into this design.
