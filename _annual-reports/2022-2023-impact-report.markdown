In this year's impact report, we reflect on HOT's transformations since its creation in 2010 after the Haiti Earthquake. Following our new Living Strategy, we aim to consolidate ourselves as a catalyst for community-driven open mapping, which we have done through our four Regional Hubs, as this report showcases. You will also find exciting technological advances and new milestones, as we move closer to mapping an area home to one billion people.
