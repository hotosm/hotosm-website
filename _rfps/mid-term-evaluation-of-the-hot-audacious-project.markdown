## About Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of more than 100 staff spread among 37 countries, HOT is an NGO which
supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and many others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster and humanitarian crises.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED’s Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities with a very
dedicated focus on local-led initiatives, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities, opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs around the world (Asia Pacific, East & Southern Africa, West & Northern Africa, and Latin America & the Caribbean), and finding talent that represents the communities with which we work.

## About the Assignment

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is requesting proposals from qualified consultants to undertake a mid-term evaluation of the HOT Audacious project. Over the last three years (2020-2022), HOT established four Regional Hubs (Eastern & Southern Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Western & Northern Africa), with the intent to support community-led mapping projects in 94 countries. Each Hub works on locally-led mapping projects implemented directly by the Hub or in collaboration with a local partner. Through various initiatives, HOT  provides grant funding, capacity-building opportunities or technical assistance in the collection and use of geodata to partners in the priority regions. Our vision for impact is **to enable people who are systematically underrepresented in countries at high risk of humanitarian crisis and multidimensional poverty to experience improved well-being, reduced suffering, and increased resilience to respond to crises through the creation, accessibility, and use of geo data.**

In implementing our current [Theory of Change](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JztyvqYt5wMgrQ7NNk_y3RvrQ4EGx1WO/view), and desiring to achieve the aspirations within it, we would like to document the evidence of our work, understand the trends in achieving the results, and its impact on our primary stakeholders. Our four long-term outcomes center:

1. Movement building, engaging underrepresented groups to contribute to the map and the movement;

2. Establishing vibrant local ecosystems;

3. Enabling the use of geodata within national and local governments, the private sector and;

4. Humanitarian and development organizations to better respond to humanitarian crises and to increase their overall effectiveness.

We have undertaken a significant number of projects and programs with local communities, volunteers, and partners around the world. We now want to assess the Audacious project impact in terms of its effectiveness, relevance, and value in achieving results. The outcomes of the mid-term evaluation will guide the final three years of project implementation and beyond.

**Purpose of the evaluation:** This mid-term evaluation aims to help us assess, document, and understand the intended and unintended outcomes and impact we have contributed to through our work.

**Objective 1:** To evaluate the **effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and likeliness of achieving the intended impact** of HOT Projects. Specific to ‘effectiveness’, to generate evidence demonstrating the outcomes (intended or unintended) and impact of the work we have implemented at the regional and global levels.

The following questions should be answered in demonstrating our work towards achieving this objective.

### To what extent has HOT been effective? Has HOT been achieving its target outcomes? And what are the intended outcomes so far?

*What significant changes have HOT and its partners contributed to while working in different communities? The changes should be related to our four major outcomes in our Theory of change, which include:*

1. Movement building, underrepresented groups actively contribute to the map and the movement;
2. Vibrant local data ecosystems are established;
3. National & local governments and the private sector use OSM to plan and contribute to humanitarian response and national development;
4. Humanitarian and development actors use open data to increase their effectiveness in reaching communities not previously visible.
  
*How have the different stakeholders, i.e., underrepresented groups, government, humanitarian and development actors, and the private sector, benefited from our work?*

### To what extent has HOT been efficient? How well have resources (funds, people, time) been used?

### To what extent will HOT Projects likely achieve their intended impact?

### To what extent are HOT projects sustainable? Will the benefits last? To what extent has the capacity of HOT’s partners been strengthened to continue program implementation and/or alter their approach?

**Objective 2:** To document learnings about the effectiveness and efficiency of our work in our communities.

The following questions should be answered in demonstrating our work towards achieving Objective 2:

1. What lessons can be identified regarding the **effectiveness** and **efficiency** of implementing projects at the Hubs and global levels?

**Objective 3:** To propose actionable and pragmatic recommendations that inform HOT’s current and future portfolio of programs and projects\*

The following questions should be answered in demonstrating our work towards achieving Objective 3:
1. What aspects of the HOT Audacious project should be scaled up?
2. What could be done differently?
3. What programs or projects should be dropped?

\*Subject to discussion with hired Consultant(s)

## Methodology and Scope of Work

### Proposed Methodology

For this mid-term evaluation, HOT seeks a mixed methods approach, which would include both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The integration of qualitative approaches such as Outcome Harvesting, Most Significant Change, Outcome Mapping, and Social listening are preferred. We would also like to capture the views and perspectives of local communities and partners from countries where HOT has not yet implemented any projects but are among the 94 priority countries of the Audacious Project. The consultants, in liaison with HOT, can further develop and refine the approach. The data collection methods will mainly include:
* Document reviews: reviewing all documentation agreed upon during the inception phase.
* Key informant interviews: will be used while interacting with agreed key informants across HOT projects.
* Focus group discussions: will be used in some instances, especially while interacting directly with communities where we work.
* A survey approach can be agreed upon, especially when gathering specific views from the stakeholders that HOT had directly worked with at Hub and global levels.

While presenting findings in the evaluation report, the consultant will be required, among other considerations, to: 
* Present the perspectives of all respondents systematically and without bias, especially where qualitative data collection methods have been used.
* Generate data through methods and approaches that are reliable and valid. 
* Present findings based on data triangulated and correlated with all possible available data sources. 
* Ensure that our contribution to all the changes documented through this process is plausible and easily linked to our work. 

This mid-term evaluation will be conducted in all four regions with a focus on collecting data and interacting with agreed respondents where HOT either works directly or indirectly through OpenStreetMap Communities or Implementing partners across the globe. As HOT has not yet implemented granting or programming in all countries, we see an opportunity to select countries where HOT has and has not worked in order to carry out a comparative analysis, if not to have a control group. The sampling process will be largely purposive sampling; however, this will be more contextualized at inception after an agreement has been reached between HOT and the consultant on who the respondents will be including their locations.

**Who will you be working with on our team?**
* Monitoring & Evaluation Lead
* Regional MERL Leads - comprised of MERL focal persons in each Regional Hub
* Head of Strategy & Impact

**Expected outputs of this assignment**

We expect the Consultant to provide the following outputs:
* An inception report, informed by a documents review and key stakeholder interviews, outlining the methodology and approved by the coordinating team at HOT
* A full evidence report, not more than 30 pages plus annexes, with insights and recommendations
* A summary of findings, with visuals (ex. Infographics, photos), that includes: 1-page summary of all major outcomes, 1-page summary for each major outcomes, 1-page summary for each Hub/Region
* Outcomes and/or impact stories documented in a user friendly manner; preferably with visuals  (ex. Infographics, photos), including: 1 story for each major outcome, 1 story for each Hub/Region, 1 story for each Project
* Five minute video on org-wide outcome/impact story
* Organized online folder with key outputs, methodology and raw data, materials, and tools
