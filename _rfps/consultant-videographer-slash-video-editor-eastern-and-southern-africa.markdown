The Open Mapping Hub -Eastern & Southern Africa \[ESA-Hub\] is a regional collaboration of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) \[HOT\] . HOT sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The ESA-Hub is seeking a videographer/video Editor on a short-term basis to capture a series of video content (9 short videos) and photography (several images) to document the learnings, open mapping methodologies, and successes of the Open Mapping Grants.

The Open Mapping Grants program is an initiative by the ESA Hub that provides funding to open mapping organizations and communities in Eastern and Southern Africa. The purpose of the program is to support the design and implementation of innovative map data solutions and projects that have a significant positive impact on people's lives in the region.

The Open Mapping Grants program is currently supporting eight projects in five countries in the region. The projects consist of a wide and diverse application of open map data from advancing access to contraceptives to centering community voices in disaster preparedness and creating opportunities for youth engagement in social change initiatives.
