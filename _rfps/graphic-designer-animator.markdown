### **About the assignment:**

[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) (HOT) is looking for a talented and versatile graphic designer / digital animator to help us shape a concept for a highly engaging, immersive and unconventional Annual Report using a rich media storytelling approach for 2021-22.

We are looking to create something that will take viewers on a journey, with a more user-driven, interactive approach that will allow them to “choose their own adventure” rather than only a single path, scrolling vertically / horizontally, and combine digital animation with video, photos, maps and text.

Our core work revolves around maps for community development and humanitarian action. We would like the Consultant to use this ‘geo’ theme to inform the concept of the report, showcasing our success stories in a creative way, incorporating themes such as interactive maps, movement, mobility, travel, place, and zooming into featured initiatives, e.g. users can virtually ‘travel’ across the globe to a country and ‘zoom in’ to a community and ‘visit’ a specific project, meet the people involved and learn about the impact it has had.

### **About HOT**

HOT sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of about 100 staff spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED’s Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities, through decentralizing and opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs.

### **About the Open Mapping Hubs**

HOT has set up three [regional Open Mapping Hubs](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) in Asia-Pacific (2021), East & Southern Africa (2021), West & Northern Africa (2022), and is currently planning hub setup in Latin America and the Caribbean (TBC). These hubs engage with local mapping communities, facilitate knowledge exchanges, distribute funding, and provide training and support with the goal of massively scaling local edits to OpenStreetMap in 94 countries. The Open Mapping Hubs are a key feature of HOT’s expansion and decentralization.

### **About OpenStreetMap**

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the whole world and a vibrant data ecosystem where many different types of actors (from individual volunteers, the biggest tech companies in the world - UN, World Bank, NGOs) are all working in a single place to build the most complete accurate map of the world that has ever existed. OSM is released with an open-content license. Anyone can edit OpenStreetMap, and anyone can use OpenStreetMap. As HOT and the Open Mapping Hubs are part of the OSM community, the website must acknowledge this position.
